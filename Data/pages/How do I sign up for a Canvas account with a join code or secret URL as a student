<p>If you are using Canvas through your institution, you will most likely already have an account and need to accept a course invitation. Your institution will email your login information. If you do not yet have an account, you can create an account when you accept the course invitation.</p>
<p>If you are not using Canvas through your institution, you can create your own account. Your instructor will provide you with a join code to link you directly to the course. This code will be sent to you separately from the Canvas email that invites you to join the course. <em><strong>If you need to create an account in Canvas but have not received your join code via email, please contact your instructor or institution for help with logging in. </strong></em></p>

    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Once you create an account, you can request to delete your account at any time. Deleting your Canvas account cannot be undone and will delete all Canvas information including courses, assignments, grades, and participation. Do not request to have your account deleted unless you are certain you absolutely no longer require any access to your prior Canvas activity. To request to have your account deleted, <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-get-help-with-Canvas-as-a-student/ta-p/498" target="_blank">open the Help menu</a> and submit a ticket to Canvas support through the <strong>Report a Problem</strong> link.</p>
