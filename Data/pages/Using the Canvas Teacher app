    <p>Currently, functionality involving adding course content or viewing the gradebook is not available in the Canvas Teacher mobile app. However, course content and assignment settings can be edited. Collaborative activities, such as creating announcements, moderating discussions, and communicating through Canvas inbox, are available. Additionally, instructors have <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Teacher-iOS-Guide/How-do-I-grade-an-assignment-submission-in-the-Teacher-app-on-my/ta-p/2005" target="_blank">access to SpeedGrader</a> to provide scores and valuable feedback to students. </p>
