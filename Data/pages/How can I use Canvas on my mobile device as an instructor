    <p>You can access Canvas from any browser on your Android/iOS device. However, mobile browsers are not supported, and features may not function as expected compared to viewing Canvas in a fully supported desktop browser. </p>
<p>On mobile devices, Canvas is designed to be used within Canvas mobile applications. Canvas pages within a mobile browser are only supported when an action in the app links directly to the browser, such as when a student takes certain types of quizzes. Support is not extended to pages that cannot currently be used in the app, such as Conferences or Collaborations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Canvas offers limited support for native mobile browsers on tablet devices. For details, please reference the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13692" target="_blank">limited-support mobile browser guidelines</a>.</p>
