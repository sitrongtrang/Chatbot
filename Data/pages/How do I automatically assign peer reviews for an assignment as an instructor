    <p>When you <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-peer-review-assignment/ta-p/641" target="_blank">create a peer review assignment</a> with automatic peer reviews, Canvas will assign peer reviews to students automatically once they have submitted their own assignment. </p>
<p>You can also tell Canvas to automatically assign peer reviews after an assignment due date has passed. </p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>It may take up to one hour for Canvas to assign peer reviews.</li>
<li>If a student has not submitted the assignment or submits the assignment after the due date, the student will not automatically be assigned a peer review and you must manually assign one.</li>
<li>On Paper and No Submission assignment types must have <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-manually-assign-peer-reviews-for-an-assignment/ta-p/650" target="_blank">manually assigned peer reviews</a>.</li>
<li>If a student enrollment is deleted or becomes inactive, students will no longer be assigned to complete a peer review for the deleted or inactive enrollment. However, peer reviews already completed by the deleted/inactive enrollment will still display for students and instructors. If peer reviews have already been assigned, you may need to adjust assigned peer reviews.</li>
<li>Instructors must manually assign peer reviews to ensure that students who are part of the same group do not get assigned to each other on a group project. </li>

    <p>Canvas will automatically assign a peer review to the student. Assigned peer reviews appear underneath the student names. A<strong> check mark </strong>[1] indicates a peer review has been completed. A<strong> warning icon</strong> [2] indicates a peer review still needs to be completed. </p>
<p>If the student has not submitted the assignment or submits the assignment after the due date [3], the student will not automatically be assigned a peer review and you must manually assign one.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>It may take up to one hour for Canvas to assign peer reviews.</li>
<li>A student's peer review is considered complete after they comment on the submission. If a rubric has been added to the assignment, they must also fill out that rubric.</li>

    <p>In group assignments, you also have the option to allow intra-group peer reviews. </p>
<p>Peer reviews require a student to review an individual submission by another student. However, group assignment submissions are made by one group member on behalf of the entire group, and all group members have the same submission.</p>
<p>By default, the <strong>Allow intra-group peer reviews</strong> checkbox is not selected, which means Canvas will exclude members of the same group when assigning peer reviews. However, by selecting the checkbox, reviews can be assigned randomly to all members of the course, including members of the same group. </p>
<p>To allow Canvas to automatically assign a peer review to any student in any other group, including students from within the studentâ€™s own group, select the Allow intra-group peer review checkbox. Selecting the checkbox allows assignments to be truly random and disregard group associations. </p>
