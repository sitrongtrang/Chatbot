    <p>The Learning Mastery Gradebook helps instructors and admins assess the outcome standards being used in Canvas courses. This gradebook helps institutions measure student learning for accreditation and better assess the needs of their students.  </p>
<p>The default view in the Learning Mastery Gradebook is to view all students at the same time, but you can also view students individually using <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-outcomes-or-student-results-individually-in-the/ta-p/1094" target="_blank">Individual View</a><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The Learning Mastery Gradebook is currently a course opt-in feature. To enable this gradebook, learn how to manage feature options in the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-manage-feature-options-for-a-course/ta-p/710" target="_blank">course features lesson</a>.</li>
<li>The mastery level names and colors may be customized by your institution.</li>
<li>When you add a rubric to a moderated assignment, any associated outcome results display in the Learning Mastery Gradebook only after final grades are posted.</li>
<li>Students can also view outcomes in a course if the Student Learning Mastery Gradebook feature option is enabled.</li>

    <p>The Learning Mastery Gradebook is organized like the assignments gradebook with the student names and sections on the left [1]. Similar to the assignments gradebook, you can click a student's name to link to their Grades page. Each column consists of a course outcome and the outcome grade for each student [2]. Also like the assignments gradebook, the columns can be sorted, resized, and reordered. Click an outcome column heading to sort the outcome by student name [3].</p>
<p>The Learning Mastery Gradebook also contains a sidebar that shows the outcome levels for the course [4]. The sidebar can be minimized and expanded by toggling the gray arrow icon at the top of the sidebar. You can filter outcomes or students that have no outcome results [5]. You can also export a report of student outcomes [6].</p>
<p>The Learning Mastery Gradebook displays 20 students per page. Use the numbered page navigation buttons to view additional students on other pages [7].</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Hide outcomes and Hide students filters persist for the course while using the same web browser.</p>

    <p>Individual student scores within each outcome are based on outcome values. The first number indicates the score the student earned. The second number indicates the mastery threshold, which is the minimum the students need to achieve mastery for the outcome. For instance, if a student earns a score of 5/3, the student has earned 2 points above the base mastery threshold of 3 points [1]. If a student achieves a score of 2/3, the student has not achieved enough points to reach the mastery threshold [2].</p>

    <p>Scores are color-coded to show outcomes and the level attained by each student. View the outcome levels and colors in the sidebar. To filter scores for specific learning mastery levels, click the outcome level in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Score levels are calculated based on half of the outcome mastery threshold. For example, if the mastery threshold is 3 points, half of 3 is 1.5. Scores between 1.6 and 2.9 are counted near mastery, while scores less than 1.5 are considered remedial. Therefore, a student score of 2/3 would be above 1.5 and count as near mastery.</p>

    <p>Outcome statistics for the entire course or a course section can be viewed according to course average, course median, or course mode. Select the preferred statistic from the drop-down menu next to the score indicator for each outcome. </p>
<p>The course average is calculated by adding all the earned scores then dividing the total of the mastery scores. The course mode is calculated by finding the score that occurs most often. The course median is calculated by sorting the scores in ascending order, then finding the middle score. These course statistics also display color-coded level results based on the outcome results.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If an outcome is aligned to multiple items, the gradebook statistics will always generate from the student’s highest outcome score within that course.</p>
