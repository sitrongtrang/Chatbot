    <p>Scheduler is a Calendar tool that creates appointment groups within a course or group. Students can sign up for a time slot within the appointment group. Some appointment time slots may only allow one student to sign up at a time, while others may allow an entire group to sign up. </p>
<p>Only students can sign up for appointment slots in the Scheduler. If a student signs up for an appointment slot, an observer who is observing the student can view the appointment in the student's calendar. Observers cannot sign up for an appointment on behalf of a student.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Scheduler tool is optional in the Calendar. If you are an instructor and Scheduler is not available to you, please contact your Canvas admin. If you are an admin, contact your Customer Success Manager.</p>
