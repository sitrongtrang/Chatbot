    <p>A peer review discussion enables students to provide feedback on another student's reply to a class discussion. Peer reviews are a tool that allows communication between students and can help students master the concepts of a course and learn from each other. </p>
<p>Peer reviews can only be added as part of a graded discussion. Unlike peer review assignments, discussions cannot be assigned anonymously. </p>
<p>Also unlike assignments, discussions do not allow students to complete peer reviews for students in other groups. When you require peer reviews for a group discussion, students can only complete peer reviews for discussion replies made by other students in their group.</p>

    <p>To complete a peer review, students must review the discussion and leave a comment on the submission details page [1].</p>
<p>Students cannot view previously submitted comments by any other reviewers, including comments by TAs or other instructors.</p>
<p>You can also assign a rubric to the graded discussion. If the discussion includes a rubric [2], students must only complete the rubric to complete the peer review. However, you can choose to ask your students to also leave a comment in the comment sidebar. The rubric score is used for an assessment opinion only; you must review the graded discussion and assign the final grade.</p>

    <p>Students do not receive a grade for completing a peer review. If you want to assign extra points for peer reviews, you can create a No Submission assignment in the Gradebook and assign points manually. The Peer Review page for the discussion will show the names of students who have completed the peer review.</p>
