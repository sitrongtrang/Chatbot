    <p>In Canvas, the Teacher Assistant role is most commonly used to enroll individuals who will work with and support a teacher in a course and who do not need to earn course credit. Teachers are also referred to as instructors in Canvas. Teacher assistants may view and moderate a course and direct daily course communications under a Teacher’s supervision. However, these permissions may vary among institutions. </p>
<p>Other course-level user roles with varying course-level access exist in Canvas. <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Designer-role/ta-p/14" target="_blank">Designers</a> may work with <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-role/ta-p/86" target="_blank">Teachers</a> (who oversee teacher assistants) and together they create course content with which <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Student-role/ta-p/71" target="_blank">Students</a> and <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Observer-role/ta-p/4" target="_blank">Observers</a> engage. For more information about course-level user permissions, view the <a href="http://bit.ly/cnvs-course-permissions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas Course Permissions PDF</a>.</p>

    <p>The main use of the Teacher Assistant role is to support a course instructor. Teacher assistants can create course materials, access and manage Canvas course materials, and engage with others enrolled in the course. For example, instructors sometimes use teacher assistants to grade assignments in courses with large student enrollments. </p>
<p>Teacher assistant access to Canvas courses depends on the institution. Teacher assistants may have access to all past, current, and future courses. Alternately, Teacher assistants may only be enrolled in and granted access to individual courses. A teacher assistant may be enrolled in a course automatically by SIS import or manually by an instructor. </p>
