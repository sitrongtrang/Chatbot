<p><strong>Discussions </strong>[1]: These are current discussions within your student's course. Discussions are ordered by most recent activity. You will only see this section heading if there are discussions within this section.   </p>
<p><strong>Pinned Discussions </strong>[2]: These are discussions that your student's teacher wants you to pay specific attention to and will appear at the top of the Discussions page. <em>You will only see this section heading if there are discussions within this section as designated by your student's teacher.</em>    </p>
<p><strong>Closed for Comments </strong>[3]: These discussions have been manually closed for comments, or the discussion is past the available from/until date.

<ul>
<li>If the discussion does not have a date listed, the discussion is open; you can reply to the discussion at any time during your course [1].  </li>
<li>If the discussion says <strong>Not Available Until</strong> [date], the discussion is locked until the specified date [2].</li>
<li>If the discussion says <strong>Available until </strong>[date], you can reply to the discussion until the specified date [3].</li>
<li>If the discussion is in the <strong>Closed for Comments</strong> section, the discussion cannot accept submissions [4]. Discussions in this section may show a "Was locked at [date]" to indicate when the discussion was closed for comments [5].  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 pm.</p>
