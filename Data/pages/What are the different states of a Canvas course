    <p><em>Unpublished courses</em> are courses in preparation; they are courses being authored by instructors, instructional designers, and administrators. While a course is unpublished, students cannot access or participate in the course. When the course material is deemed ready by the designer, instructor, or administrator, it may be <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-publish-a-course/ta-p/1185" target="_blank">published.</a></p>
<p>These courses appear in the Future Enrollments section of the Courses menu.

<p>If a course is never published, the course will remain in the students' Future Enrollments section. </p>

    <p><em>Published courses</em> are instantly available to students who may be assigned via SIS integration, or manually by the instructor, administrator, or TA. When published, activity is dictated by the dates and status of course assignments and modules. Individual assignments, modules, or other course content can be individually locked (made unavailable to students) or assigned a date in the future, prior to which students will not be able to see or participate in said course component.</p>
<p>If courses are set within term dates, these courses appear in the My Courses section of the Courses menu. However, if courses have course participation dates and have different start dates, the courses appear in the Future Enrollments section until the course participation start date.</p>
