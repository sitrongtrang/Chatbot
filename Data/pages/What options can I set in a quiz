  <div id="text-content_1788DA20-06B1-0135-3886-22000BC102FE" class="text-block-content">
    <p>Quiz settings have several options.</p>
<p><strong>Shuffle Answers </strong>[1]:<strong> </strong>You can shuffle (randomize) answers. (You can also shuffle questions by <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-quiz-with-a-question-group-to-randomize-quiz/ta-p/1032" target="_blank">creating a question group</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Time Limit</strong> [2]: You can choose to set a time limit by entering the number of minutes students have to complete the entire quiz. Timed quizzes begin once a student begins the exam and <strong>do not pause </strong>if the student navigates away from the quiz. If no time limit is set, students will have unlimited time to complete the quiz.</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a timed quiz is automatically submitted after a student loses internet connectivity, the submission time stamp and time to complete the quiz may not align with the allotted time limit and/or the availability dates.</li>
<li>If a student loses internet connectivity, Canvas extends the time for five minutes, saving the answer entered before the timer runs out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multiple Attempts </strong>[3]: You can allow multiple attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Quiz Responses</strong> [4]: You can choose to allow students to view their answers, any automatic feedback generated by the quiz for correct or incorrect answers, and which questions they got wrong. Quizzes default to this option, so if you do not want students to see their quiz responses, deselect the checkbox.</p>
<p>As part of this option, you can restrict students view of the quiz results to <strong>Only Once After Each Attempt</strong> [5]. Students will only be able to view the results immediately after they have completed the quiz—results include both their responses and the correct answers.</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students will still see their quiz score upon submitting a quiz when this option is enabled. Because of this, this option may not be appropriate for quizzes that require manual grading, such as essay questions, where students may need to access the quiz results multiple times to see an updated quiz score.</li>
<li>When a quiz is saved with the Only Once After Each Attempt option, you can use the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/Once-I-publish-a-quiz-how-do-I-use-the-Moderate-Quiz-page/ta-p/761" target="_blank">Moderate Quiz</a> feature to give students additional views to their quiz results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answers</strong> [6]: You can allow students to see correct quiz answers after completing the quiz. This setting enables a green Correct tab on every correct answer for the entire quiz. Quizzes default to this option, so if you do not want students to see the correct answers, deselect the checkbox.</p>
<p>As a part of this option, you can also control when and for how long students can see the correct answers by setting dates (and specific times, if desired) in the Show and Hide fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>To show answers immediately after quiz is submitted, leave the Show and Hide fields blank.</li>
<li>To create a date range to display the answers, set a start date in the Show field and an ending date in the Hide field.</li>
<li>To always show answers after a specific date, set a date in the Show field.</li>
<li>To hide answers after a specific date, set a date in the Hide field.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Note:</strong> If the Only Once After Each Attempt option is selected, it will override any show or hide dates or times. If you want to show or hide correct answers on any specific date or time, the Only Once option should not be selected.</p>
<p><strong>One Question at a Time</strong> [7]: You can show <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-can-I-create-a-quiz-where-students-only-see-one-question-at/ta-p/1175" target="_blank">one question at a time</a> and lock questions after answering.</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions will be locked even if a student clicks the Next button without answering the question.</li>
<li>If your Canvas admin has restricted students from viewing quiz submissions after the course ends, options 4 and 6 will not be available after the course end date has passed.</li>

    <p>A few of the settings contain expanded menu options:</p>
<p><strong>Allow Multiple Attempts </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Quiz Score to Keep</strong> [1]: You can choose whether to keep the highest score, latest score, or average score of all attempts. By default, Canvas keeps the highest score unless you change this setting. </li>
<li>
<strong>Allowed Attempts</strong> [2]: You can allow multiple attempts and limit the number of attempts. The default dashes represent unlimited attempts. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:rgb(29,29,29);"><em>If you retain the Quizzes default option for students to see their quiz responses:</em></span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you <strong>allow at least one attempt for the quiz</strong>, the Let Students See Their Quiz Responses area will display an Only after their last attempt checkbox [3]. Selecting this option means that students can only see their correct responses after their last quiz attempt. </li>
<li>If you <strong>allow more than one attempt for the quiz</strong>, please be aware that not all students may complete all attempts and therefore may never see their quiz responses. For instance, if a student has three attempts but achieves their desired score in the second attempt, the student will most likely not complete the third (and last) attempt. That means their quiz responses and correct answers will not appear because the last attempt was not completed. To allow these students to see their responses, you would have to manually change the quiz settings at a later time.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:rgb(29,29,29);"><em>If you retain the Quizzes default option for students to see the correct answers:</em></span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you <strong>allow at least one attempt for the quiz</strong>, the Let Students See The Correct Answers area will display a Only after their last attempt checkbox [4]. Selecting this option means that students can only see the correct quiz answers after their last attempt. This option will follow the current quiz functionality around multiple attempts. If a student never makes it to the last attempt, the correct answer setting will not apply. To allow the student to view the correct answers, you can manually change the quiz options at a later time.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Show One Question at a Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lock questions after answering</strong> [5]: You can choose to lock questions after answering. This option means that students cannot return to the previous question once it has been answered.</li>

<p>To filter IP addresses, enter the IP address in the IP address text field [2].</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An access code may contain any number of characters. </li>
<li>You can change an access code at any time. This has no effect on students who have already taken the quiz or those who have not. However, if you change the access code while students are taking the quiz, the students may be forced out of the quiz as soon as they answer a question, click the Next button, or cause a page refresh. Students must start the quiz again using the new access code.</li>
<li>Quiz IP filters are a way to limit access to quizzes to computers in a specified IP range. Filters can be a comma-separated list of addresses, or an address followed by a mask (i.e., 192.168.217.1/24 or 192.168.217.1/255.255.255.0).

<li>Changing who the quiz is assigned to after the quiz is made available to students may result in submissions becoming unavailable.</li>
