    <p>You can enter a website URL as a submission in a Canvas course that uses Assignment Enhancements. When a URL is submitted as an assignment, Canvas takes a screenshot of the web page at the time it was submitted. This lesson shows how to turn in a standard online assignment in a course using Assignment Enhancements. You may also have the option to resubmit assignments if your instructor allows. </p>
<p>Before submitting an assignment, you may want to review all assignment information, such as the assignment rubric. </p>
<p><strong>Third-Party File Application Submissions </strong></p>
<p>You can submit assignments from Google Drive, Dropbox, or another third-party service via your desktop computer in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the file to your computer and <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-upload-a-file-as-an-assignment-submission-for-a-course/ta-p/416664" target="_blank">submit as a File Upload</a> </li>
<li>Share the file, copy the file URL, and submit as a Website URL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the assignment you are accessing displays differently, Assignment Enhancements may not be enabled in your course or your instructor may not have used a supported assignment type. Please view <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-enter-a-URL-as-an-assignment-submission/ta-p/286" target="_blank">this guide</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Assignment Enhancements does not support Cloud Assignments.</li>
<li>Not all file types may be available for your assignment, depending on the assignment submission type set by your instructor. </li>
<li>Not all of your assignments may be submitted online. If you cannot see options to submit your work, your instructor may want you to submit your assignment in a different way or the assignment is not within its availability dates. View the assignment header and details for instructions, or contact your instructor for assistance.</li>
