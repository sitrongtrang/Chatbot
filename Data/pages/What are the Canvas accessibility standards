    <p>Ensuring an accessible and pleasant experience to all users, regardless of disability, is a key element of Canvas software. The Canvas platform was built using the most modern HTML and CSS technologies, and is committed to W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative and <a href="https://www.section508.gov/" target="" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Section 508</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT, is a tool that administrators and decision-makers can use to evaluate Canvas' conformance with the accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. View more information about the <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas Voluntary Product Accessibility Template</a>.</p>
<p>General accessibility design guidelines can be found in the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Accessibility/General-Accessibility-Design-Guidelines/ba-p/252642" target="">General Accessibility Design Guidelines</a> document. </p>

    <p>Each Canvas feature and release is manually tested with the following screen reader and browser combinations: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">JAWS</a> (latest version for Chrome/Firefox on Windows)</li>

</ul>
<p>Browser and screen reader pairing is selected based on current screen reader and browser usage statistics, ensuring that preferred combinations are always maintained for the widest range of Canvas users. As preferences shift and stabilize over time, Canvas testing and support shift to match them.</p>
<p>Canvas is designed so that screen reader users can confidently utilize their preferred screen reader and browser. However, the variety of browser and screen reader combinations means that only the above-listed combinations are tested and confirmed to work well in Canvas. If you experience issues using your preferred browser and screen reader combination, please review and utilize the officially supported combinations listed above. If you experience issues with the officially supported screen reader and browser combinations, please report your experience to Canvas Support.</p>

    <p>Canvas makes extensive use of ARIA landmark regions. Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. Therefore, the best way to get around in Canvas is to navigate via regions. Within regions, Canvas uses HTML headings, so navigating between headings can be helpful.</p>
<p>When using a screen reader, the <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas page navigation menu</a> is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Main navigation</p>

    <p>Several Canvas features have been specifically improved for accessibility. Other features may be limited at this time. This section highlights several feature areas and accessibility behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Calendar: </strong>The Calendar supports Agenda View, which lists all assignments and events in a list or agenda format. Learn how to access the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Calendar-as-an-instructor/ta-p/917" target="">Calendar Agenda View</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chat: </strong>The Chat Tool has an option to enable audio notifications when new messages are posted.</p>
<p><strong>Font Sizing: </strong>The Canvas interface uses rem sizing for fonts so any typography will zoom when the browser is zoomed and will scale if a custom browser-sized font is chosen or set from a browser's setting.</p>
<p><strong>Gradebook: </strong>Both the Gradebook and the Learning Mastery Gradebook support an individual view, where instructors can view assignments and grades for one student at a time. Learn more about individual view in the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-assignments-or-students-individually-in-the/ta-p/1247" target="">Gradebook </a>and <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-outcomes-or-student-results-individually-in-the/ta-p/1094" target="">Learning Mastery Gradebook</a>.</p>

    <p>Canvas offers many optional LTI app integrations as part of our commitment to open education. When we review new integration tools, accessibility features are always an important consideration. Unfortunately, as integrations are created by third-party developers and offered to Canvas clients as an optional service, we cannot always ensure that these integrations meet the same standards that we hold for core Canvas. Therefore, if an institution wants to incorporate an integration where additional features may be required, we recommend the institution contact the developer directly with any specific concerns.</p>
<p>Some integrations are non-optional hosted services within Canvas. Any accessibility issues for Canvas-hosted services should be submitted as a help ticket via the institution's support process. We are open to suggestions for new integrations and have an area in the <a href="http://community.canvaslms.com" target="">Instructure Community</a> forums for feature requests.</p>
