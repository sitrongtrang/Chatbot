    <p>If your course includes Multiple Grading Periods, grading periods created at the account level automatically display in your course and can be filtered in the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Assignments-Index-Page/ta-p/777" target="_blank">Assignments Index Page</a>, the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Gradebook/ta-p/701" target="_blank">Gradebook</a>, and the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-student-s-Grades-page-in-a-course-from-the/ta-p/751" target="_blank">student Grades </a>page.</p>
<p>Grading periods consist of a specific date range that define the grading period. Grading periods also include a close date as to when you can no longer edit grades in a grading period. Grading periods can also be weighted. To view grading period date ranges and any weighted grading periods, you can view grading periods in a course.</p>
<p> At the course level, Canvas validates all assignments against closed grading periods in Canvas. For a complete overview of the Multiple Grading Periods feature and current limitations associated with close dates, please view the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Releases-Board/Canvas-Release-Close-Dates-for-Grading-Periods-2017-01-28/m-p/250047" target="_blank">Close Dates for Grading Periods</a> document in the Canvas Community.</p>

    <p>When you create an assignment, by default each assignment is assigned to everyone. However, the assignment can be differentiated among course sections, course groups, or individual students. </p>
<p>When grading periods are enabled, the due date of the assignment determines the grading period where the assignment appears in the Gradebook. If no due date is set, the assignment defaults to the last grading period available for the course.</p>
<p>When grading periods are weighted, assignments outside of grading periods do not count toward the final grade.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Assign field cannot be edited for anyone if the due date is in a closed grading period. However, you can add additional differentiated assignments with due dates outside the closed grading period. Assignments with due dates in open grading periods cannot be edited from an open grading period to a date in a closed grading period, but the due date can be edited to any date within an open grading period. These restrictions do not apply to availability dates, which can be set to overlap a grading period.</p>
