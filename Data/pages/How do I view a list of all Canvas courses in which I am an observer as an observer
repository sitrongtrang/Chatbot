    <p>After logging into Canvas, you can view a list of all courses in which you are enrolled as an observer. You may also be able to view past and future course enrollments in Canvas.</p>
<p>If you cannot access one of your student's courses, review the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating a Canvas account and linking your account using a pairing code, you may not have completed the registration process.</li>
<li>If your institution enrolled you in your student's course, your enrollment may not have been set up properly. Please contact your student's instructor(s) for assistance.</li>
<li>Each course is associated with a specific access date. Depending on the date associated with the course, you may not yet be able to view the course.</li>
<li>Courses must be published by your institution before you can access them. If a course is not accessible to you in your course list, it may not be published.</li>
<li>Access to concluded courses may be restricted by your institution.</li>
<li>Confirm your browser is up to date. Outdated browsers cannot support Canvas courses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some institutions may restrict the option to view or access future enrollment courses before the start date and/or access concluded courses after the course has ended.</p>

    <p>All Courses are courses that are part of the current semester or term. However, depending on access settings for a course, My Courses can also display courses that have not yet started or that are unpublished.</p>
<p>Active courses that are available to you are listed in blue text [1]. These courses have been published and include a link to the course. To open a course, click the name of the course. Courses that are within the current term dates but are not yet available are listed in black text [2]. These courses have not been published.</p>
<p>You can also view any nicknames you have created for courses [3]. </p>
<p>If a course includes a term date [4], the term date displays next to the course name.</p>
<p>Each course includes your enrollment status [5]. Statuses can be student, teacher, TA, observer, designer, or a custom role as created by your institution. </p>
<p>In the All Courses section, you can <a href="/t5/Observer-Guide/How-do-I-customize-my-Courses-list-as-an-observer/ta-p/564" target="_blank">customize the courses list</a> and mark courses as favorites [6].
