    <p>When creating an assignment, you can choose to set up an assignment with moderated grading. Moderated grading allows multiple reviewers to grade a student's work and create draft or provisional grades for an assignment. For instance, you may want to allow two Teaching Assistants to grade all assignments, and you can review their assessments before determining the final grade. Moderated grading is also useful for creating a sampling of students for assignment review to ensure grading is consistent and allows secondary grade reviews. </p>
<p>When you <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-to-an-assignment/ta-p/1058" target="_blank">add a rubric to a moderated assignment</a>, any associated outcome results display in the Learning Mastery Gradebook only after final grades are posted. </p>
<p>In moderated grading, anyone with assignment creation permissions can specify an assignment submission to be reviewed by one or multiple graders, edit the assignment if necessary, review the grades, and select which grade should be set as the final grade for each student. For each moderated submission, the user set as the moderator is the only user who can specify the final grade for each assignment. Any grader can be specified as the grader who can determine the final grade as long as they have the corresponding permission, but the moderator does not have to personally grade the assignment. Once the assignment is created, only the moderator and admins will be able to change the assigned final grader. </p>
<p><strong>Moderated Grading</strong></p>
<p>For moderated assignments, when an assignment reaches its maximum number of graders, the grading notification will be removed from the Dashboard for graders who have not yet assessed the assignment. However, submissions can still be accessed through the Gradebook, if needed. SpeedGrader displays submissions in a read-only mode to hide all student names and submission details. </p>
<p><strong>Anonymous Grading</strong></p>
<p>Moderated grading can be enabled with <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-assignment-that-includes-anonymous-grading/ta-p/769" target="_blank">anonymous grading assignment options</a>. If enabled in an assignment, anonymous grading is enabled by default in SpeedGrader, although <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-hide-student-names-in-SpeedGrader/ta-p/768" target="_blank">anonymous grading in SpeedGrader</a> can be enabled separately if not enabled for an assignment.</p>

    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderated grading is currently a course opt-in feature. To enable this feature, learn how to manage feature options in the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-manage-feature-options-for-a-course/ta-p/710" target="_blank">course features lesson</a>.</li>
<li>Once an assignment has been set as a moderated assignment, the moderated assignment option cannot be disabled once submissions have been received, but any edits made to the moderated settings are tracked. To view edits to moderated settings as well as other grading actions, <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-audit-an-assessment-in-SpeedGrader/ta-p/660" target="_blank">audit the assessment in SpeedGrader</a>.</li>
<li>Once an assignment has been set as a moderated assignment, course roles must have the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-Course-Role-Permissions/ta-p/387080" target="_blank">Grades - select final grade for moderation permission</a> to publish or edit moderated assignments. </li>
<li>Grades cannot be edited in the Gradebook before grades are <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-publish-final-grades-for-a-moderated-assignment/ta-p/681" target="_blank">released as final grades to the Gradebook</a> by the moderator. However, after grades are posted, grades can be edited in the Gradebook by any grader.</li>
<li>Moderated assignments are automatically muted or hidden in the Gradebook until grades are posted.</li>
<li>Moderated assignments are not supported with Peer Review assignments.</li>

<ul>
<li>Canvas allows for a maximum of 10 graders. If you enter a number larger than 10, the page displays a message that only 10 graders are available in the course.</li>
<li>A moderator does not have to specify which specific graders in the course can grade submissions.

When an assignment has reached the specified number of graders, remaining graders will not be able to access the assignment anywhere in Canvas.</li>
<li>The moderator is never included in the number of available graders since the moderator does not traditionally grade individual submissions. However, the moderator may choose to provide a custom grade instead of selecting a grade from one of the graders.</li>
