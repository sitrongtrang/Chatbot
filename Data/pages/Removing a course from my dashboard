    <p>Your Canvas Dashboard displays both active and favorited courses. Active courses are courses that are published and that are within the course start and end dates. <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-my-favorite-courses-in-the-Card-View-Dashboard-as/ta-p/517" target="_blank">Favorited courses </a>are courses you have starred.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have dropped a course, it may take up to 24 hours for your enrollment status to update in Canvas. If a dropped course still displays in your Dashboard after this time, you should confirm with your institution that you are fully dropped from the course. </p>

    <p>You may be able to view a list of your past enrollments in your Courses List. If a course in the Past Enrollments list is favorited, you can click the <strong>Favorite</strong> icon to unfavorite the course. </p>
<p>If you have a course that has ended but is still on the dashboard, it is likely that it is missing an end date in the course settings. As a student, you cannot change this.</p>
<p>If youâ€™d like to remove it, your instructor will need to add an end date. <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-send-a-message-to-a-user-in-a-course-in-the-Inbox-as-a/ta-p/502" target="_blank">Contact your instructor for assistance using the Inbox</a><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10574-4212710325" target="_blank"> </a>or through the help menu.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-customize-my-Courses-list-as-a-student/ta-p/500" target="_blank">course favoriting</a> to determine which courses appear on your dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Courses in the Past Enrollments list cannot be favorited. </p>
