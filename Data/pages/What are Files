    <p>Files can house course files, assignments, syllabi, readings, or other documents, as well as profile pictures and user-specific files. Instructors can lock folders and files so they can only be viewed by direct links or only unlock on a specific date.</p>
<p>Files can be placed in Modules, Assignments, or Pages. Files and folders are put in alphabetical order and cannot be rearranged. </p>
<p>Canvas users will find access to files (documents, images, media, etc.) in three different places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal files, located in each user's profile (students, teachers, and TAs)—<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Files-Students/ta-p/383756" target="_blank">View a video about personal files</a>
</li>
<li>Course files, located in each course (students, teachers, and TAs unless files are locked by the teacher)—<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Files-Overview/ta-p/384392" target="_blank">View a video about Course Files</a>
</li>
<li>Group files, located in each group (students and teachers who are enrolled in groups)</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn about specific file quota details for each user role, view the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-File-Quotas/ta-p/387061" target="_blank">Course Files Quota resource document</a>.</p>
