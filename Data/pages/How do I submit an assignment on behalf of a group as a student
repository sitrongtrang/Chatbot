    <p>A group assignment is a way for instructors to allow students to work together on an assignment and submit it as a group. Only one group member needs to submit the assignment on behalf of the group. </p>
<p>Any attachments added as part of a graded assignment submission are also copied to your <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-group-files-as-a-student/ta-p/351" target="_blank">group files</a> but are not counted against your user quota. However, once the file has been uploaded as a submission, you cannot delete the file. If you upload a file from your computer, the file is stored in the group Submissions folder. However, please note that if you submit a file that was previously uploaded to your group files, the file is stored in your Submissions folder. Files uploaded using the Rich Content Editor count toward your user storage quota.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to submit a file that was previously uploaded, the file must already be in your user files. Any files that have been uploaded to the group's files cannot be accessed through assignment submissions. Learn how to <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-move-and-organize-files-as-a-student/ta-p/467" target="_blank">move group files to user files</a>.</li>
<li>If enabled in your account, Canvas plays a celebration animation when you submit an assignment on time. However, if you prefer, you can <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/What-feature-options-can-I-enable-in-my-user-account-as-a/ta-p/431" target="_blank">disable this feature setting</a> in your user settings.</li>
