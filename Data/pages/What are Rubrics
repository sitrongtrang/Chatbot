    <p>Rubrics are a way to set up custom or Outcome-based assessment criteria for scoring.</p>
<p>A Rubric is an assessment tool for communicating expectations of quality. Rubrics are typically comprised of rows and columns. Rows are used to define the various criteria being used to assess an assignment. Columns are used to define levels of performance for each criterion.</p>
<p>Rubrics can be set up as non-scoring rubrics, which allows for assessment-based and outcome-based grading without points.</p>

    <p>Account-level rubrics are rubrics that are <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-in-an-account/ta-p/172" target="_blank">created at the account</a> or sub-account level. They can be used by any course within that account or sub-account for assignments, discussions, or quizzes. If an account-level rubric is used in more than one place, it becomes uneditable, but is still usable. </p>
<p>Account-level rubrics can be used to create institutional or departmental question repositories. The purpose of account-level rubrics is to provide resources for teachers, not control content. For example, if the English department offered several courses to teach basic grammar rules to students, a department could create a sub-account level rubric. Instructors could then access the rubric to offer the same evaluation standards to students in different courses. </p>

Once a rubric has been used to assess a student, the rubric cannot be edited. However, existing rubrics can be recopied and used on other assignments.</p>
