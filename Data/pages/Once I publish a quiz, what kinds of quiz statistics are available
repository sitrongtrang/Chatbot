    <p>You can view quiz statistics for quizzes that have been published and have at least one submission. You can also download comma separate value (CSV) files to view Student Analysis or Item Analysis for each quiz question. For more detailed information about item analysis limitations and calculations, please refer to the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-Quiz-Item-Analysis/ta-p/387082" target="_blank">Item Analysis resource document</a>. </p>
<p>For optimum course performance in the Canvas interface, quiz statistics will only generate for quizzes with 100 or fewer unique questions or 1000 total attempts. For instance, a quiz with 200 questions will not generate quiz statistics. However, a quiz with 75 questions will generate quiz statistics until the quiz has reached 1000 attempts. Results greater than these maximum values can be viewed by downloading the Student Analysis report and viewing the CSV file.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Editing a quiz with student submissions may affect quiz statistics. If the Question Breakdown charts no longer correctly display the information you expect after you edit a quiz, the Student Analysis report can provide the correct data.</li>
<li>Media items do not display in quiz statistics.</li>
<li>Answers that were edited or created in the Rich Content Editor for a Multiple Answers quiz question do not display in quiz statistics. </li>
</ul>

    <p>By default, the quiz summary shows statistics for all sections including the quiz average score, high score, low score, standard deviation (how far the values are spread across the entire score range), and average time of quiz completion [1]. </p>
<p>To view quiz statistics for a section, click the <strong>Section Filter </strong>drop-down menu [2]. To access additional survey results, generate a Student/Item Analysis report [3].</p>
<p>In the summary graph, the x-axis indicates the quiz scored percentages [4], and the y-axis indicates the number of students who received each percentage [5].</p>
<p>If a student had multiple assignment attempts, you can <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-the-details-of-a-submission-for-a-student-in/ta-p/762" target="_blank">view past attempts</a> in SpeedGrader.

    <p>True/False and Multiple Choice quiz questions include an item discrimination index, which provides a measure of how well a single question can tell the difference between students who do well on an exam and those who do not. </p>
<p>It divides students into three groups based on their score on the whole quiz: the top 27%, the middle 46%, and the bottom 27%. The number of correct answers from the bottom group is subtracted from the number of correct answers in the top group, then the total is divided by the size of the group.</p>
<p>Lower discrimination scores are scored +0.24 or lower; good scores are +0.25 or higher. An ideal discrimination index shows students who scored higher on the quiz getting the quiz question right, students who scored lower on the quiz getting the quiz question wrong, and students in the middle range on either side. A discrimination index of zero shows all students getting the quiz question right or wrong.</p>
<p>Ideally, students who did well on the exam should get the question right. If students do well on the overall exam but not on the question, the question itself may need to be revised.</p>
