    <p>The My Files folder creates folders based on default events in Canvas. Once you upload a file related to one of these areas, the folder and accompanying file will be created for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Conversation attachments</strong> folder [1] stores files that you attach to Conversations messages.</li>
<li>The <strong>Data Exports </strong>folder [2] contains ZIP files created when you <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-download-assignment-submissions-from-all-my-courses/ta-p/298" target="_blank">download assignment submissions from all your courses</a>.</li>
<li>If your institution enables you to upload a profile picture, the <strong>Profile pictures </strong>folder [3] stores photos that you upload as a profile picture. </li>
<li>The <strong>Submissions </strong>folder [4] contains copies of your assignment submissions; assignment are organized by course folder and displayed alphabetically. However, assignments submitted through an external tool are not copied to the Submissions folder.</li>
<li>The <strong>Unfiled </strong>folder [5] stores files that you attach to discussion topics or discussion replies (if attachments are allowed by your instructor).</li>
</ul>
<p>My Files also includes any additional folders you create to organize your files, as well as any files not uploaded to a specific folder. Any files in the My Files folder that are not related to assignment submissions count toward your user quota.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Files uploaded using the Rich Content Editor count toward your user storage quota. However,<a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-upload-a-file-as-an-assignment-submission-in-Canvas/ta-p/274" target="_blank"> files uploaded as an assignment submission</a> do not count toward your user quota. </li>
<li>For online <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-an-online-assignment/ta-p/503" target="_blank">assignment submissions</a>, if you submit a file that you've previously uploaded, you can delete the previously uploaded file after it has been submitted and free up extra storage in your user files.</li>
