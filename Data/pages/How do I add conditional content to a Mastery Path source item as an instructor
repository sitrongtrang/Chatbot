    <p>Mastery Paths release conditional content to students based on scoring-range rules. After the source assignment or assessment is graded (either manually or automatically), the student’s score designates which conditional item(s) are assigned as a learning path. For instance, a student who scores above 90% on an assignment could be assigned more advanced work, while a student who scores below 60% could view assignments designed for content clarification and improvement. Please note that resubmitted source items may affect conditional paths, as updated grades may change the conditional assignments released to the student.</p>
<p>Any graded assignment, graded discussion, or graded quiz may be used as the source content for a Mastery Path. </p>
<p>Any course item except for practice quizzes, ungraded surveys, and external tool assignments may be designated as a conditional item in a Mastery Path. Course items such as links, files, and media content must be embedded in a page or assignment to be used as conditional content in Mastery Paths.</p>
<p>A Mastery Path should originate from an assignment assigned to everyone, such as a pre-test or an introductory assignment.</p>
<p>Once you have added conditional content to a Mastery Path source assignment, you must <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-assign-a-conditional-assignment-for-students-to/ta-p/1025" target="_blank">differentiate each conditional assignment for </a>Mastery Path<a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-assign-a-conditional-assignment-for-students-to/ta-p/1025" target="_blank">s</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because content pages do not require grading, content pages cannot be used as a Mastery Path source item and can only be added as conditional content. However, a <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-allow-a-page-to-be-a-Mastery-Path-module-item/ta-p/858" target="_blank">page must be allowed for </a>Mastery Path<a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-allow-a-page-to-be-a-Mastery-Path-module-item/ta-p/858" target="_blank">s</a> before it can be added to a conditional path.</li>
<li>‪If conditional items are added to a path and later changed (such as separating conditional items in the same range or adding another item), the change will not apply to any students who have already been graded based on the original conditional path. Conditional items should be final when course content is published.‬</li>
<li>As conditional items are released to students, individual due dates for items are not applied. To add a due date to conditional items, wait until all students have completed the source assignment and then <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-assign-an-assignment-to-an-individual-student/ta-p/717" target="_blank">add a due date to the conditional item</a>. </li>
<li>Conditional content items can be set up with their own conditional items.</li>
<li>All module items should be published before the course is available to students. If an unpublished item is added as a conditional content item, the student will not be able to view the content until the item is published. Any publishing delays may have unintended consequences for the student's conditional path. </li>
<li>If your course has a large number of students and/or if a Mastery Path has a large number of associated conditional items, students may experience a delay before they are assigned a path.</li>
<li>The Mastery Paths setting can be <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-set-details-for-a-course/ta-p/1037" target="_blank">managed in your course</a> if the setting has been <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-set-details-for-an-account/ta-p/194" target="_blank">enabled by your institution</a>.</li>
