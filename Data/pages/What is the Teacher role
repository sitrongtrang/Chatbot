    <p>In Canvas, the Teacher role is used to enroll users responsible for course creation, instruction, and management. Teachers are also referred to as instructors in Canvas. In general, users with the Teacher role have permissions that allow them to moderate a course, view course data, and direct daily course communications. However, these permissions may vary among institutions. </p>
<p>Other course-level user roles with varying course-level access exist in Canvas. <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Designer-role/ta-p/14" target="_blank">Designers</a> may work with Teachers (who oversee <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-Assistant-role/ta-p/84" target="_blank">Teacher Assistants</a>) and together they create course content with which <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Student-role/ta-p/71" target="_blank">Students</a> and <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Observer-role/ta-p/4" target="_blank">Observers</a> engage. For more information about course-level user permissions, view the <a href="http://bit.ly/cnvs-course-permissions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas Course Permissions PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Teachers may also use the Canvas Teacher app to view some course content including announcements, assignments, discussions, and quizzes. </p>

    <p>Teachers may create course materials, view course data, and access and manage all areas of a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may be added to a course with the Teacher role to lead a course. </p>
<p>The main uses of the Teacher role are to allow a user to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Create and modify course content</li>
<li>Moderate and submit grades</li>
<li>Manually invite others to the course</li>
<li>Communicate with course participants</li>
<li>Access course analytics and student data</li>
<li>Monitor and moderate the participation and interactions of all enrolled users in a course</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user manually creates a course, Canvas automatically enrolls that user as a Teacher in the course. A teacher may also be enrolled in a course manually by an administrator or automatically by SIS import.</p>
