    <p>New Analytics provides interactive graphs and tables that allow instructors and students to track data related to course grades, activity, and communication. Instructors can track student grades, submission status, weekly course activity, individual student participation, and online attendance. Instructors can also use New Analytics to message students based on their submission status or grade.</p>
<p>Students can use New Analytics to view and download data about their course grades, weekly online activity, and Inbox communication.</p>
<p>Data displays in interactive chart graphs or tables. You can also download the data.</p>
<p>Data is refreshed for published courses in the New Analytics dashboard every 24 hours. Report data may be delayed by 24 hours; however, Course Activity Report data may be delayed by 40 hours. Only active and completed student enrollments are included in data for New Analytics. Deleted or inactive user enrollments do not generate data.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, New Analytics is managed at the account and course levels through the New Course and User Analytics <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-Feature-Option-Summary/ta-p/531316" target="_blank">feature option</a>. New Analytics will replace the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-Course-Analytics/ta-p/968" target="_blank">current analytics</a> feature at the course and user levels in a future release.</li>
<li>In order for New Analytics to display in Canvas, you may need to <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-enable-third-party-cookies-in-my-browser/ta-p/605670" target="_blank">enable third-party cookies</a> in your browser settings.</li>
<li>New Analytics data does not display for unpublished courses.</li>
<li>Users can view New Analytics only if their <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-set-permissions-for-a-course-level-role-in-an-account/ta-p/101" target="_blank">course role permission</a> includes <em>Analytics - view pages</em>.</li>
<li>Because mobile page view data is based on device settings and network connection, it may vary from the time the page views actually occurred. Page view data should not be used to assess academic integrity.</li>
<li>Unposted assignments are not included in New Analytics course grade tab.</li>

    <p>A "page view" is when you open a page in a course. Page views can give indicate how a user has been accessing course resources. However, because page view data is based on requests to the server, use page view data as a good approximation to activity and not an absolute metric. Page view data is most valuable for understanding whether activity occurred, and to make comparisons across students within a course or when viewing trends week to week.</p>
<p>Several actions define participation in Canvas and collectively describe events where a user takes an action within a course. The following student actions generate analytics course participation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Announcements: posts a new comment to an announcement</li>
<li>Assignments: submits an assignment</li>
<li>Collaborations: loads a collaboration to view/edit a document</li>
<li>Conferences: joins a web conference</li>
<li>Discussions: posts a new comment to a discussion</li>
<li>Pages: creates a page</li>
<li>Quizzes: submits a quiz</li>
<li>Quizzes: starts taking a quiz</li>
