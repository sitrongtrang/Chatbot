    <p>In Canvas, the Designer role is used to enroll users responsible for course creation and management. In general, users with the Designer role have permissions that allow them to create and curate course content and view course usage data. However, these permissions may vary among institutions. </p>
<p>Other course-level user roles with varying course-level access exist in Canvas. Designers may work with <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-role/ta-p/86" target="_blank">Teachers</a> (who oversee <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-Assistant-role/ta-p/84" target="_blank">Teacher Assistants)</a> and together they manage course content with which <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Student-role/ta-p/71" target="_blank">Students</a> and <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Observer-role/ta-p/4" target="_blank">Observers</a> engage. For more information about course-level user permissions, view the <a href="http://bit.ly/cnvs-course-permissions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas Course Permissions PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Designers may also use the Canvas Teacher app to view some course content including announcements, assignments, discussions, and Classic Quizzes.</p>
<p>A designer may be enrolled in a course manually by an administrator or automatically by SIS import.</p>
