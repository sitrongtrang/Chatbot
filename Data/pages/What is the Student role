    <p>In Canvas, the Student role is most commonly used to enroll users who will participate in a course for course credit. Users enrolled as Students can view course content and participate in course assignments and communications. Students cannot view and participate a course until it is published and the course has started. </p>
<p>Other course-level user roles with varying course-level access exist in Canvas. <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Designer-role/ta-p/14" target="_blank">Designers</a> may work with <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-role/ta-p/86" target="_blank">Teachers</a> (who oversee <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-Assistant-role/ta-p/84" target="_blank">Teacher Assistants</a>) and together they create course content with which Students and <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Observer-role/ta-p/4" target="_blank">Observers</a> engage. For more information about course-level user permissions, view the <a href="http://bit.ly/cnvs-course-permissions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas Course Permissions PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Students may also use the Canvas Student app to view and participate in courses. </p>

    <p>The main use of the Student role is to link Canvas users to courses where they may access course content in order to receive course credit. For example, Students in a Canvas course often take quizzes and tests and submit assignments for a course grade.</p>
<p>Students can participate in any Canvas area their teacher has enabled for the course. Students can be linked to one or multiple courses and may submit work, see grades, assignments, and events, and interact with other course members. </p>
<p>Depending on the institution, students may have different levels of access to Canvas courses. Students may have access to all past, current, and future courses. Alternately, students can be enrolled in individual courses. Students may be enrolled in a course automatically by SIS import, or manually by a teacher, or by self-enrollment. </p>
