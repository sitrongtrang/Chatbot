<li>If your student's school enrolled you in a course, your enrollment may not have been set up properly. Please contact your student's teacher(s) for assistance.</li>
<li>Each course is associated with a specific access date. Depending on the date associated with the course, you may not yet be able to view your student's course.</li>
<li>Courses must be published by your student's school before you can access them. If a course is not <em>accessible</em> to you in your course list, it may not be published. </li>
<li>Access to concluded courses may be restricted by your student's school.</li>
