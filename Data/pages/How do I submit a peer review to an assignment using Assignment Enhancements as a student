    <p>Your instructor may require you to submit a peer review of another student's assignment. To complete the assignment, you must review the student's assignment and add a comment in the comment sidebar.</p>
<p>If your instructor includes a rubric, which is a pre-determined outline of how an assignment is graded, you must assign a grade using the rubric. However, your instructor may also ask you to leave a comment in the comment sidebar.</p>
<p>Some peer reviews may also be anonymous, which means you cannot view the name of the student whose assignment you are reviewing. Additionally, the student cannot see your name as the reviewer when you leave a comment to complete the review. Â </p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Peer reviews can only be completed in the web version of Canvas.</li>
<li>Your instructor may choose to hide the Assignments link in Course Navigation. If the Assignments link is not available, you can still access assignments through your user or course dashboard, the Syllabus, Gradebook, Calendar, or Modules.</li>
<li>Observers can view all content from submitted assignments. However, observers cannot view assignment drafts.</li>
<li>Assignment Enhancements does not support Cloud Assignments.</li>
<li>If the <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-a-peer-review-to-an-assignment/ta-p/293" target="_blank">assignment you are accessing displays differently</a>, Assignment Enhancements and/or Peer Review Support may not be enabled in your course or your instructor may not have used a supported assignment type.</li>
