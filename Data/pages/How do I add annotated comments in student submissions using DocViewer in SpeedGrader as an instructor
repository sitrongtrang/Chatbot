    <p>Canvas DocViewer is a tool that allows annotations on online assignment submissions in Canvas. You can use DocViewer to view files and assignments in SpeedGrader. You can view when students view annotated feedback in the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-the-details-of-a-submission-for-a-student-in/ta-p/762" target="_blank">assignment details</a> section of the sidebar.</p>
<p>DocViewer has a 10-hour session limit that begins when you open a submission. If you start to make an annotation but do not submit it before the session expires, the annotation will not be saved. Submitted annotations are saved and are not affected by the session limit. Canvas will display a session expiration warning at 9 hours 50 minutes, followed by a 5-minute and 1-minute warning until the 10-hour limit has been reached. You can restart a DocViewer session at any time by refreshing the submission page.</p>
<p>If your browser includes a built-in PDF viewer, select the option to view the PDF in the system viewer. </p>
<p>A student can view your DocViewer comments from the assignment Submissions Details page.</p>
<p><strong>Compatible DocViewer Files</strong></p>
<p>If a submission includes a <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-types-of-files-can-be-previewed-in-Canvas/ta-p/607" target="_blank">file that can be rendered in DocViewer</a>, but the submission preview is not yet complete, Canvas will generate a message stating the document is still processing. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files over 100 MB and password-protected files will not be converted by DocViewer.</li>
<li>Annotation tools are not available for text entry assignments.</li>
<li>SpeedGrader may take up to ten minutes after an assignment is submitted to display a file that supports DocViewer.</li>
<li>In mobile devices, DocViewer annotations are only fully supported in the Canvas Teacher app.</li>
<li>Canvas DocViewer does not support anonymous comments, so it cannot be used for annotated feedback on assignments with anonymous peer reviews.</li>
<li>If an assignment is anonymously graded, students will not be able to view instructor annotations until the assignment is unmuted or assignment grades have been posted. </li>
<li>If students have enabled the Submission Comment notification, they will receive notifications when you add comments to their document. If annotation comments have been made anonymous, students receive notifications that do not include the name of the user who posted the comment. If the assignment has a manual posting policy, you may need to post grades and/or comments for students to receive a notification.</li>
</ul>
