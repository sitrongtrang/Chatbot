    <p>One of the challenges facing both students and instructors is keeping track of all of the assignments planned throughout the term. Instructors are teaching multiple courses and students are learning in multiple courses. Every course has its own timeline for when things need to be done. The Calendar helps everyone stay on schedule and up to date.</p>
<p>The Calendar in Canvas is a global feature, meaning users can see all courses assignments and events in one place. Calendars can be filtered by selecting or deselecting courses in the sidebar.</p>
<p>To help manage user calendars, courses customized in the courses drop-down menu as a favorite course will always be listed at the top of the userâ€™s calendar list in the calendar sidebar. By default, the Calendar displays a maximum of 10 course calendars. To increase the amount of course calendars that can display to users in your Canvas account, contact your Customer Success Manager.</p>

    <p>The Calendar is used for reminding students of graded Assignments with specific due dates. To provide students with detailed descriptions of how synchronous class time will be used, consider using Pages or customizing the Course Home Page.</p>
<p>The Calendar automatically syncs with other features in Canvas, such as Assignments, Syllabus, and Grades, so if you create, change, or delete the due date of an Assignment on the Calendar, it will show up in all the others and vice versa. You can change dates easily by dragging and dropping assignments from one date to another. </p>
