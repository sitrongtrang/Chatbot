    <p>As an instructor, you may be able to restrict student access to your course before or after the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-change-the-start-and-end-dates-for-a-course/ta-p/452354" target="_blank">course participation dates</a>. By default, course participation dates are limited to term dates. You can restrict students from viewing the course before or after term dates. Or, if your course has set course participation dates, you can restrict students from viewing the course before or after the set course dates. For more information, view the interactive <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Student-Course-Visibility-and-Participation-Flowchart/ta-p/387094" target="_blank">Student Course Visibility and Participation flowchart</a>. </p>
<p>Please be aware that the settings for student access are already set by your institutional admin. If settings are available to you, you can modify them for your course. If settings are locked, you cannot change the settings for your course.</p>
<p><strong>Restrict students from viewing course before term or course start date</strong>: When a student enrolls in a future course, the course displays in the Future Enrollments section in the student's Courses list. Once a course is published, the course displays an invitation to join the course. When students join a future course, they can view course content at any time before the course begins. If your course participation dates are limited to term dates, you can restrict students from viewing course content before the term start date by enabling the Restrict students from viewing course before term start date option. If your course participation dates are limited to set course dates, you can restrict students from viewing course content before the course start date by enabling the Restrict students from viewing course before course start date option. Course dates override term dates. If the course start date is after the term start date, you must enable this option if you want to restrict access before the course start date. If course participation is limited to set course participation dates and a start date has not been added, students can access the course prior to term start date. </p>
<p><strong>Restrict students from viewing course after term or course end date</strong>: Once a course has concluded, students can still view the course but all content is displayed in a read-only state. If your course participation dates are limited to term dates, you can restrict students from viewing course content after the term end date by enabling the Restrict students from viewing course after term end date option. If your course participation dates are limited to set course dates, you can restrict students from viewing course content after the course end date by enabling the Restrict students from viewing course after course end date option. Course dates override term dates. If the course end date is after the term start date, you must enable this option if you want to restrict access after the course end date. If course participation is limited to set course participation dates and an end date has not been added, students can access the course after the term end date. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Although any <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-change-the-start-and-end-dates-for-a-course-section-as/ta-p/1265" target="_blank">changed section dates</a> override course dates, student access restrictions cannot be set at the section level, and restriction options apply to all sections within the course.</li>
<li>Restricting student access does not apply to users who do not have course enrollments and are accessing the course through <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-customize-visibility-options-for-course-content/ta-p/814" target="_blank">Public or Institution visibility options</a>.</li>

    <p>Courses may be assigned to the Default Term or a specific term [1]. By default, students will be able to participate in the course within the term dates [2].
