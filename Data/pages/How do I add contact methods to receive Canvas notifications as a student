    <p>In Canvas you can add contact methods to receive notifications. Contact methods allow you to select how you want to be notified when various events occur within a course. Notifications are applied to all courses in Canvas. Canvas supports notification through email, Slack, and various web services.</p>
<p>Once you add contact methods, you can <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-manage-my-Canvas-notification-settings-as-a-student/ta-p/434" target="_blank">set your own Notification Settings</a> to select how often you want to be notified of course events. </p>

01:23: Other services that are available for registration appear in the right column under the Other Services heading.

01:29: When you allow third-party integrations to access your account, the Approved Integrations section will appear and display the authorized integrations. Each integration will show you the name of the app, the purpose (if one is noted), the date the app was last used, the date the app expires, and a link to view further details.
