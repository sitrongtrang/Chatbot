    <p>A group assignment allow students to work together on an assignment and submit it as a group using Assignment Enhancements. Only one group member needs to submit the assignment on behalf of the group. </p>
<p>Files uploaded using the Rich Content Editor count toward your user storage quota. Any attachments added as part of a graded assignment submission are also copied to your <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-group-files-as-a-student/ta-p/351" target="_blank">group files</a> but are not counted against your user quota. However, once the file has been uploaded as a submission, you cannot delete the file. If you upload a file from your computer, the file is stored in the group Submissions folder. However, please note that if you submit a file that was previously uploaded to your group files, the file is stored in your Submissions folder.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When a group assignment is submitted, any submission drafts belonging to other group members are deleted. </li>
<li>Previously uploaded group files cannot be accessed in the assignment details page. To submit a previously uploaded group file as an assignment submission, you must <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-move-and-organize-files-as-a-student/ta-p/467" target="_blank">move the group file to user files</a>. </li>
