    <p>LTI provides a framework through which an LMS (Canvas) can send some verifiable information about a user to a third party. For LTI to work, the third party needs to provide a consumer key and shared secret that Canvas can use to generate a signature to verify the authenticity of the data sent. By default most user information is anonymized, but this can be changed when the configuration is first set up.</p>
<p>External Apps can be configured on the account or course level. </p>

    <p>External Apps add functionality to a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may want to include a study aid (flashcards, mini-quizzes, etc.) to help students better understand the concepts being taught. </p>
<p>Admins can add external apps for accounts and subaccounts via XML, URL, or manual configuration.</p>
<p>If apps do not already exist for a course, instructors can add external apps in their courses to create additional learning paths for students. External apps can be added to Modules, Course Navigation, the Rich Content Editor, and Assignments.</p>
<p>In the Rich Content Editor, external apps can be <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-select-content-from-an-external-app-in-the-New-Rich/ta-p/391282" target="_blank">accessed from the Apps icon</a> or <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-external-tool-to-the-New-Rich-Content-Editor/ta-p/398262" target="_blank">added to the toolbar for an account</a>.</p>

    <p>Admins and instructors can also enable apps through the App Center, which is integrated directly in Canvas.</p>

<li>Add new features to Canvas at the account or course level</li>
<li>Configure apps to link to modules or assessments</li>
<li>Install apps without the help of IT</li>
<li>Created a customized teaching experience</li>
<li>Open the door to more possibilities </li>
<li>Filter apps by name</li>
<li>View installed apps</li>
</ul>
<p>The App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. </p>
<p>Admins can manage the apps that can be used in courses for accounts and subaccounts by <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-manage-an-allow-list-in-the-Edu-App-Center/ta-p/203" target="_blank">creating an allow list</a> in the Edu App Center and <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-link-an-Edu-App-Center-allow-list-to-Canvas/ta-p/247" target="_blank">managing the allow list</a> in Canvas. </p>
