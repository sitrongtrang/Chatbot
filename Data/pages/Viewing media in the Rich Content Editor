    <p>Viewing media in the Rich Content Editor requires a Canvas-supported browser. </p>
<p>If media does not play using a supported browser and was uploaded by the course instructor, verify with the instructor that the media is accessible to course users. By default, media that is recorded or uploaded using the Rich Content Editor is visible to users within the announcement, assignment, discussion, page, quiz, or syllabus. However, if the uploaded file's restriction settings were changed to unpublished or are outside of the file's visibility dates, users will not be able to view the file. </p>
