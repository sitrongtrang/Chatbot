    <p>The first dates you may see are called availability dates. Sometimes your instructor only wants you to submit a quiz during a specified date range, so the available dates are the range of time that the quiz is accessible to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the quiz does not have a date listed, the quiz is open; you can complete the quiz at any time during your course.  </li>
<li>If the quiz says <strong>Available until </strong>[date], you can complete the quiz until the specified date. </li>
<li>If the quiz says <strong>Not Available Until</strong> [date], the quiz is locked until until the specified date.</li>
<li>If the quiz says <strong>Closed</strong>, the quiz cannot accept quiz submissions.  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you start a quiz but do not submit it, Quizzes includes an autosubmit feature that will submit the quiz for you on the <strong>Available until </strong>quiz date. If a quiz does not include an Available until date, the quiz will autosubmit on the last day of the course. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 pm.</p>

    <p>The second set of dates are the Due dates [1] for each respective quiz. Any quizzes submitted after the due date are marked as late; some instructors may deduct points for late submissions. Again, not all quizzes may include a Due date. </p>

<p><em>Please be aware that the Due date may be <strong>before or on</strong> the Available date. </em></p>
<p>Due dates also include a time [2]. If your instructor does not set a due time, the listed date displays the course's default due time.</p>

    <p>When a quiz is open to you to take at any time, you can view the due date, points, and questions for the quiz. </p>
<p>You can also view additional details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Time Limit</strong> [1]: the length of time you have to complete the quiz. If your quiz has a time limit, you must complete the entire quiz within that time in one sitting. If you navigate away from the quiz, the timer will keep running. You will also be kicked out of the quiz when the time limit has been reached.</li>
<li>
<strong>Instructions</strong> [2]<strong>:</strong> any instructions that your instructor has about the quiz.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In the example above, the quiz is due by September 15. However, if you were to miss the due date, you could still take the quiz for late credit before the last day of the course.</p>
<p>To <a href="/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-take-a-quiz/ta-p/507" target="_blank">take the quiz</a>, click the <strong>Take the Quiz </strong>button.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you start a quiz that has a due date, but do not finish the quiz by the due date (as indicated in your local time zone), Canvas will automatically submit the quiz on the due date. </li>
<li>Quiz details do not show the due date in relation to the current time. For example, if a quiz has a due date of 11:59 pm and you begin the quiz at 11:30 pm, you will only have 30 minutes to complete the quiz before it is marked late. The same time restriction applies if you are taking a timed quiz. For example, if the Time Limit was set to 60 minutes but you begin the quiz at 11:30 pm, you still only have 30 minutes to complete the quiz before it is marked late. Canvas will notify you regarding any time restrictions when you begin the quiz.</li>

The Due date may be <strong>before or on</strong> the last available date (if one is set).</p>
<p>In the example above, the quiz is available to you starting April 8 at 12 am and is due by April 9 at 11:59 pm.
