    <p>Analytics evaluate individual components of a course and evaluate student performance. Analytics takes a three-pronged approach to creating substantive data for Canvas users. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Justification</strong> focuses on system reports and how the system is being used. </li>
<li>
<strong>Intervention</strong> looks to predict at-risk students and how to meet their needs. </li>
<li>
<strong>Learning</strong> focuses on learning outcomes, the effectiveness of the teaching style, and the division of time between students achieving competence and those falling behind.</li>

    <p>Analytics can be used at any level of the account, as long as the user has the account-level permission to view analytics. For example, admins in the root account [1] can view analytics for the account and all sub-accounts. Admins in sub-accounts [2] can view the analytics for their own sub-account and any additional sub-accounts below them.</p>
<p>Admins can also view course analytics within an account or sub-account. Instructors can view course analytics if they are also given the analytics permission at the course level. </p>

    <p>In account analytics, there are four main sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Overview</strong> of what is in the account including Courses, Teachers, Students, Assignments, Discussion Topics, Files Uploaded, and Media Recordings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Activity by date</strong> allows the Admin to view how everyone is participating in the courses within the term and account.</li>
<li>
<strong>Activity by category</strong> allows the Admin to view the participation for Pages, Assignments, Modules, Discussions, Grades, Files, Collaborations, Announcements, Groups, Conferences, General, and Other.</li>
<li>
<strong>Grade distribution</strong> allows the Admin to view what the final grades and in progress grades look like during the term within the account.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Use account analytics to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the students, teachers, observers, and/or designers are participating in the course.</li>
<li>See an overview of the term within the account.</li>
<li>View how the users are interacting with the courses in the term.</li>
<li>Watch how the grade distribution fluctuates or stays steady.</li>
<li>View the total number of courses, teachers, students, assignments, submissions, discussion topics and replies, files, and media recording in the term within the account.</li>

    <p>In course analytics, there are four main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Activity</strong> allows the instructor to see when students view a page or participate in the course.</li>
<li>
<strong>Submissions</strong> allows the instructor to view if students submit the assignment on-time, late, or not at all.</li>
