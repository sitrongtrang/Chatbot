    <p>If you have moderator permissions, you can review <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-moderated-assignment-to-be-graded-by-multiple/ta-p/605" target="_blank">moderated assignments</a> that have been reviewed in SpeedGrader by graders, if needed. If an assignment includes a rubric, you can also view the rubric criterion and any feedback that have been used to grade a submission.</p>
<p>Final grades can be selected in SpeedGrader, but grades can only be posted and unmuted from the Grade Summary page for the assignment.</p>
<p>Moderated grading supports anonymity options for grader comments, grader names, student names, and final grader visibility. Depending on the assignment's moderated grading configurations, you may not be able to see certain grader or student identifiers in SpeedGrader.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individual graders can review comments within each submission at any time.</li>
<li>Students can only view comments in the submission that is selected for the final grade; they cannot view comments from any other provisional grade reviews. If you want to include any comments from additional reviewers, you will have to copy the comments manually into the submission selected for the final grade.</li>
<li>If a reviewer uses <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-annotated-comments-in-student-submissions-using/ta-p/694" target="_blank">Canvas DocViewer annotations</a>, students can only view the annotations in the assessment that was selected or copied as the final grade. In copied reviews, students can view the original reviewer's annotations as well as any annotations added by the moderator.</li>
