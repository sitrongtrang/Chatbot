    <p>The first dates you may see are called availability dates. Sometimes your instructor only wants you to submit an assignment during a specified date range, so the available dates are the range of time that the assignment is accessible to you. </p>
<ul>
<li>If the assignment does not have a date listed [1], the assignment is open; you can submit the assignment at any time during your course.  </li>
<li>If the assignment says <strong>Available until </strong>[date] [2], you can submit the assignment until the specified date. </li>
<li>If the assignment says <strong>Not Available Until</strong> [date] [3], the assignment is locked until the specified date.</li>
<li>If the assignment says <strong>Closed </strong>[4], the assignment cannot accept submissions.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 pm. </p>
