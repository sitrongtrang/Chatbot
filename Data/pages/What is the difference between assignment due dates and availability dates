    <p>In addition to setting a due date for an assignment, instructors can specify a specific date range when students can submit the assignment. These dates are called availability dates. These dates are optional and can be set depending how you want to manage the assignment. </p>
<p>In Quizzes, availability dates may affect student submissions. For more details, view the <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-make-a-quiz-available-before-or-after-the-due-date/ta-p/1241" target="_blank">Quiz availability dates lesson</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beneath the Due Date and Availability date fields, Canvas will display the time zone date and time according to context. If you manage courses in a time zone other than your local time zone and create or edit a due date for an assignment, the course and local times will be displayed for reference.</li>
<li>When Multiple Grading Periods are enabled in a course, only due dates are validated against closed grading periods. Availability dates do not apply.</li>
<li>Depending on their notification settings, students will receive a notification if you publish an assignment even if the availability date has not been met.</li>

    <p>The due date is the date and time when the assignment is due. Student assignments submitted after the due date will be marked as late in the Gradebook. Due Dates are not required in Canvas, but they are helpful in managing course workflow and deadlines.</p>
<p>You can also set a specific time as part of the due date. When you change a due time on an assignment, the seconds value defaults to 0 unless the minutes value is set to 59, in which case, the seconds are also set to 59. For example, if you set a due date of September 19 at 4:15 pm, any student submission made at or after September 19 at 4:15:01 is marked late.</p>
