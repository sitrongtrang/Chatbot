    <p>Canvas provides tools that supplement face-to-face courses by providing additional information online. Students will be able to access content for courses they are enrolled in through Canvas. Some institutions provide Canvas course sites for face-to-face courses automatically, while others require their instructors to request course sites in Canvas.</p>

    <p>In face-to-face courses, you can use Canvas features to help manage your course, such as Gradebook and Assignments. </p>
<p>You can use features to gather student work via online submissions in assignments, or deliver course content such as PDFs, documentation, and presentations using Files. </p>
<p>Canvas quizzes give you an opportunity to provide online practice quizzes or class surveys quickly and easily. </p>
<p>Canvas modules allow you to organize units of related materials that students can access from any device with an internet connection. Organized content in modules make great stand-alone resourcesâ€”review materials, videos, images, self-paced activities such as practice quizzes, or web quests. You can also use them to try new teaching practices such as flipped classroom models in select lessons. </p>
