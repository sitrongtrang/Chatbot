    <p>Canvas allows you to import CSV files to manually bulk create users, accounts, terms, courses, sections, enrollments, and logins through the Admin interface.</p>
<p>This document references the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.sis_csv.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SIS Import CSV Format API page,</a> where the majority of the CSV information is located. Each CSV file is symbiotic with another and tell Canvas how to manage all information for the account. <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-5917" target="_blank">View the SIS relationship diagram</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Sample Files</strong></p>
<p>Each step in this lesson provides details about the CSV files and descriptions of each required and optional field. Each step also includes a link to download a sample CSV file. Sample files contain all required fields and may also contain optional fields. Additionally, you can <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tr-learncanvas/files/sis-imports/SISImportPackage.zip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">download a zipped package of all sample files.</a> If CSV links do not download, try opening the link in a new tab.</p>
<p>You should practice importing data in your <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-access-the-Canvas-test-environment-as-an-admin/ta-p/180" target="_blank">Canvas test environment</a> before importing any content to your production environment.</p>
<p><strong>CSV File Format</strong></p>
<p>In order to bulk upload data into Canvas, you must create one or more CSV text files. CSV files can be generated by many programs. Student Information Systems (SIS) often have a method for generating reports in CSV format that can be modified to fit the format Canvas requires.<em> If you do not know how to save a file in a CSV format, please check the documentation for the program you are using to create your CSV file (e.g., Excel).</em></p>
<p>When using the Instructure format for importing files in the <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-import-SIS-data-to-a-Canvas-account/ta-p/98" target="_blank">SIS Import page</a>, you may import an individual CSV text file or you may compress multiple files into a single ZIP file to bulk import data. If you are manually uploading individual files, the files must be uploaded in the order shown in this lesson.</p>
<p><strong>CSV Field Formatting</strong></p>
<p>The first row of your CSV file (header) must include the complete field name for each file. The order of the <em>columns</em> does not matter but having the <em>rows</em> ordered properly is crucial for files like the accounts.csv. </p>
<p><strong>Sticky Fields</strong></p>
<p>By default, certain changes made in the user interface are not overwritten by future SIS imports and are specified as being sticky. All sticky fields are identified in this document. You can override these fields by setting <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/sis_imports.html#method.sis_imports_api.create" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">override_sis_stickiness </a>in the API or checking the Override UI changes checkbox in the <a href="/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-import-SIS-data-to-a-Canvas-account/ta-p/98" target="_blank">SIS Import page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Documentation</strong></p>
<p>CSV files only include a specific set of fields. Canvas contains additional values that are available through each individual API. After running the CSV files for your institution, standard practice for a majority of institutions is to upload all SIS CSV files and then use the Canvas API to update full account and course attributes. For more information, view the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canvas API documentation</a> for Users, Accounts, Terms, Courses, Sections, Enrollments, and Groups. SIS Imports can also be managed using the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/sis_imports.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SIS Imports API</a>.</p>

    <p>Users are the people who have user accounts within an institution. The users.csv adds people into the system as generic users. The enrollments.csv will assign a role (teacher, student, etc.) to these users. When a user account is <em>deleted</em> all of their enrollments will also be deleted and they won't be able to log in to their Canvas account. If you still want the user to be able to log in but just not participate or if you want to only delete them from a particular course, then you should leave their user account as <em>active</em> and change their enrollment (in the enrollments.csv) to <em>completed</em> or <em>deleted</em>, respectively. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<span style="color:rgb(143,0,0);"><strong>user_id*</strong></span><strong>:</strong> This is a unique value used to identify anyone with an account in Canvas. This value must not change for the user, and must be unique across all users. In the user interface, this is called the SIS ID and may be comprised of any combination of characters. You can find this SIS ID by visiting any user account and then viewing their <em>Login Information.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>integration_id:</strong> This is a secondary unique identifier useful for more complex SIS integrations. This identifier must not change for the user, and must be globally unique.</li>
<li>
<span style="color:rgb(143,0,0);"><strong>login_id*^</strong></span><strong>: </strong>This is the username one will use to log in to Canvas. If you have an authentication service configured (like LDAP), this will typically match their username in the remote system. Login_id can contain letters, numbers, or the following symbol characters:  - _ = + . @</li>
<li>
<strong>password:  </strong>If the account is configured to use LDAP or an SSO protocol, then this isn't required. Otherwise, this is the password for the 'login_id' above. This password must be at least 8 characters.</li>
<li>
<strong>ssha_password: </strong>Instead of a plain-text password, you can pass a pre-hashed password using the SSHA password generation scheme in this field. While better than passing a plain text password, you should still encourage users to change their password after logging in for the first time. Learn how to generate <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-6543" target="_blank">SSHA passwords</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>authentication_provider_id: </strong>This is the authentication provider the login is associated with. Logins associated with a specific provider can only be used with that provider. Legacy providers (LDAP, CAS, SAML) will search for logins associated with them, or unassociated logins. New providers will only search for logins explicitly associated with them. This can be the integer ID of the provider, or the type of the provider (in which case, it will find the first matching provider).  </li>
<li>
<strong>first_name^:  </strong>This is the given (first) name of the user. If present, used to construct full_name and/or sortable_name.</li>
<li>
<strong>last_name^:  </strong>This is the surname (last) name of the user. If present, used to construct full_name and/or sortable_name.</li>
<li>
<strong>full_name^:</strong> This is both the given and surname of the user. Omit first_name and last_name if this is provided.</li>
<li>
<strong>sortable_name^</strong>: This is the sortable name option in Canvas, usually inferred from the user's name but it can be customized.</li>
<li>
<strong>short_name^: </strong>This is the display name of the user, usually inferred from the user's name but it can be customized.</li>
<li>
<strong>email:  </strong>This is the <em>institution-assigned email address</em> and will also be marked as the <em>default email address</em> for this user account. This email address should still be provided even if it is the same as the user's login_id.</li>
<li>
<strong>pronouns: </strong>If personal pronouns are enabled, these are the personal pronouns that display after a user's name in Canvas. The pronouns field accepts all pronouns, even if they were not created in the Account Settings page.</li>
<li>
<strong>declared_user_type: </strong>This declared user type can be either administrative, observer, staff, student, student_other, or teacher. Can pass "&lt;delete&gt;" to remove the declared user type from the user.</li>
<li>
<strong>canvas_password_notification:</strong> This defaults to false. When true, user is notified for password setup if the authentication_provider_id is Canvas. If your institution does not have a Canvas SIS integration, this field is required to notify new users of their created accounts.</li>
<li>
<strong>home_account: </strong>Setting the home_account as true<em> </em>will create a new user in the target account for the SIS import and merge in another existing user from another account within the consortium with a matching integration_id. Will be ignored unless the target account is associated with an auto-merge consortium.</li>
<li>
<span style="color:rgb(143,0,0);"><strong>status*^</strong></span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);"><strong>:</strong></span>  This is where you can add or remove a user from Canvas.

    <p>Canvas identifies users by email address. When students are added to a course, Canvas attempts to reconcile any email address conflicts when the user first logs in to the course. </p>
<p>Normally email addresses are unique to each student. At times multiple students may share a single email address. When adding students to courses via SIS import, Canvas recognizes when an email address is assigned to more than one student.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a new SIS ID is associated with an email address already assigned to an existing SIS ID, Canvas sends an email to the email address.</li>
<li>When users are added to an account through SIS import, they will not receive an email notification unless the system detects a duplicate user. However, if a user is added or enrolled manually they will receive an email notifying them they have been added or enrolled in a new course. The student sharing an email address will receive a notification that the email address is already in use and is invited to create a new account in Canvas. <em>This process may also apply when adding a user to a course enrollment.</em>
