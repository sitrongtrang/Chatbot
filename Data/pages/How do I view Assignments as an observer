<li>
<strong>Undated Assignments: </strong>assignments, discussions, and quizzes that do not have a due date.</li>
<li>
<strong>Past Assignments:</strong> assignments and discussions that are past the due date and either are not available, have been submitted, or have received a grade; quizzes that are past the due date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each assignment also includes an icon with the assignment type: assignment [1], discussion [2], or quiz [3].</p>

    <p>The first dates you may see are called availability dates. Sometimes an instructor only wants students to submit an assignment during a specified date range, so the available dates are the range of time that the assignment is accessible to students. </p>
<ul>
<li>If the assignment does not have a date listed, the assignment is open; students can submit the assignment at any time during the course [1]</li>
<li>If the assignment says <strong>Available until </strong>[date], students can submit the assignment until the specified date [2]</li>
<li>If the assignment says <strong>Not Available Until</strong> [date], the assignment is locked until the specified date [3]</li>
<li>If the assignment says <strong>Closed</strong>, the assignment cannot accept submissions [4]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 pm.</p>

<strong>Instructions </strong>[2]<strong>:</strong> any instructions from the instructor about the assignment.

<strong>Rubric</strong> [3]<strong>: </strong>any grading criteria that the instructor has provided for the assignment. An assignment may or may not include a rubric.
