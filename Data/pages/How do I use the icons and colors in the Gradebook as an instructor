    <p>The Gradebook displays one <strong>Assignment Icon</strong> [1], regardless of assignment type, to note a submission that needs to be graded. A submission is noted as needing to be graded in the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A submission has been received but has not been graded</li>
<li>A submission was graded but the grade was removed by the instructor</li>
<li>An assignment or quiz was resubmitted</li>
<li>A quiz was submitted in Classic Quizzes, but is not fully graded (contains questions that must be manually graded, or an auto-submitted quiz score has been deleted and needs to be reassigned); can also display if a quiz has been edited and includes major changes that affect the quiz score, such as deleting questions or deleting quiz answers, and requires a grader to manually resolve</li>
</ul>
<p>An <a href="/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-hide-grades-that-were-previously-posted-in-the/ta-p/721" target="_blank">assignment with grades hidden from students</a> is indicated by the <strong>Visibility </strong>icon [2]. Additional situations apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>When weighted assignment groups are not enabled, the total column also includes a warning icon notifying you that the grade you see differs from the grade the students see because student grades on one or more graded assignments are hidden.</li>
<li>If an assignment column displays the visibility icon and all cells are grayed out, the assignment is moderated. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Assignment icon does not display for resubmitted discussions.</p>
