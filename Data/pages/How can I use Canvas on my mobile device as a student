    <p>Canvas is built on open web standards, so most features are supported on mobile devices. With the growing use of mobile devices, instructors should build their courses with best practices for mobile in mind. </p>

    <p>You can access Canvas from any browser on your Android/iOS device. However, mobile browsers are not supported, and features may not function as expected compared to viewing Canvas in a fully supported desktop browser. </p>
<p>On mobile devices, Canvas is designed to be used within Canvas mobile applications. Canvas pages within a mobile browser are only supported when an action in the app links directly to the browser, such as when a student takes certain types of quizzes. Support is not extended to pages that cannot currently be used in the app, such as Conferences or Collaborations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Canvas offers limited support for native mobile browsers on tablet devices. For details, please reference the <a href="/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-the-limited-support-guidelines-for-mobile-browsers-on/ta-p/389121" target="_blank">limited-support mobile browser guidelines</a>.</p>
