How do I customize my Courses list as a student
Open Courses
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link, then click the All Courses link.
Manage Courses
To favorite a course, click the star next to a course. Courses with filled stars show the course is a favorite. 
Notes: 
After you have manually favorited at least one course, Canvas automatically favorites any new published course enrollments for you.
You can only favorite active courses.
View Unpublished Courses
If a course is unpublished and you are allowed to view unpublished courses before the course participation dates, you cannot favorite the course. If you hover over a star icon for an unpublished course, you can view a message indicating that the course cannot be added as a favorite.
Future and past enrollments also cannot be favorited.
View Past Enrollments
Depending on course configuration, you may still be able to view your past enrollments after courses have concluded. However, favorited courses are not automatically removed as a favorite. If a past enrollment course still shows as a favorite, you can unfavorite the course by toggling the star icon.
