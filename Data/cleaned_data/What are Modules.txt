What are Modules
Instructor View
Instructors can add all course materials in modules, even if they are assigned to specific students, sections, or groups.
Use Modules to:
Create prerequisite activities that students must complete before moving on in the course
Track student progress through a sequence of learning activities
Organize course content by unit, day, week, topic or outcome
Student View
Students only view module content that has been published and assigned to them. Each module can contain files, discussions, assignments, quizzes, and other learning materials. Modules can be expanded and collapsed.
