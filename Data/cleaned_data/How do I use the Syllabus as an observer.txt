How do I use the Syllabus as an observer
Open Syllabus
In Course Navigation, click the Syllabus link.
View Syllabus
The syllabus includes the syllabus description, the syllabus table, and the sidebar.
View Syllabus Description
The syllabus description may contain the course description, a brief introduction, class guidelines, weekly reminders, and other important information from your student's teacher.
View Course Summary
The Course Summary is automatically generated for the course and contains a list of assignments and calendar events. Assignments are indicated by the Assignments icon, and events are indicated by the Calendar icon. Non-graded items with a to-do date show the to-do date in the syllabus.
Click the title to view the details of the assignment or event. Any assignments or events that are past the due date are highlighted in gray. Undated items are listed in alphabetical order. 
View Time Zones
If you have set a specific time zone in your User Settings, all course dates and times will display in your local time, but if you hover over the time, you can also see the course date and time.
View Sidebar
The sidebar section displays information about course events and grading. If your Syllabus is also set as your course home page, the sidebar may also include additional features.
The Syllabus sidebar includes a mini calendar. Any date that includes an event or assignment due date are shown with a gray background. To view an associated assignment or event in the Syllabus table, click the calendar date.
If your student's course includes weighted assignment groups, the sidebar may also shows the percentages of each group. 
Note: If you cannot view assignment group totals, your student's teacher has restricted this feature.
