How do I approximate my assignment scores using the What-If Grades feature as a student
Open Grades
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
View Current or Total Grade
View your existing grades to see how approximating scores will affect your grade. 
If available, your current grade is displayed in the sidebar. The current grade is calculated by adding up the graded assignments according to their weight in the course grading scheme and applies when the Calculate based only on graded assignments checkbox is selected in the sidebar. This checkbox is selected in the sidebar by default.
If you want to view your total grade, deselect the sidebar checkbox. Your grade will be calculated based on both graded and ungraded assignments.
View Grading Periods
If your instructor is using grading periods, the grades page defaults to the current grading period. To change grading periods, click the Grading Period drop-down menu. Click the Apply button. 
Test Assignment Score
Locate the assignment and click the score cell. 
Enter What-If Score
Enter a hypothetical score for the assignment.
View What-If Grades
The Grades page updates the total score with the What-If grade.
