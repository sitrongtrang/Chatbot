How do I allow students to like replies in a discussion as an instructor
Open Discussions
In Course Navigation, click the Discussions link.
Add Discussion
Click the Add Discussion button.
Create Discussion
Create your discussion. Enter a discussion title in the Topic Title field. Add discussion content using the Rich Content Editor. Select sections for the discussion in the Post to drop-down menu. 
Set Liking Options
In discussion options, click the Allow liking checkbox. 
When you allow discussion likes, you can select two additional options.
Only graders can like: select this checkbox if you want to limit the liking functionality to only graders in the course, which means only users with the Edit Grades permission can see the Like link. However, all users still see the total number of likes for each reply.
Save and Publish
If you are ready to publish your discussion, click the Save & Publish button. If you want to create a draft of your discussion and publish it later, click the Save button.
Publish Saved Discussion
When your discussion is saved in a draft state, you can return to the page and publish it at any time by clicking the Publish button in the classic Discussions interface or the Publish icon in the Discussions Redesign interface.
