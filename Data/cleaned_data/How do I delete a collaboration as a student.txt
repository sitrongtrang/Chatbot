How do I delete a collaboration as a student
Open Collaborations
In Course Navigation, click the Collaborations link.
Delete Collaboration
Locate the collaboration and click the Delete icon.
Remove Collaboration
To remove a Google Assignments collaboration, click the Yes, remove button.
Delete Google Doc
If you are deleting a Google Doc, Canvas will ask you if you want to delete the collaboration from Canvas or also delete from Google Docs.
If you only want to delete the Google Doc link from Canvas, click the Just Delete from Canvas button. This option removes the Google Doc link from Canvas, but users can still access the document in their Google account. 
If you want to remove the document from Google Docs as well, click the Also Delete From Google Docs button. 
Note: The Also Delete From Google Docs option immediately deletes the document from Google Docs, and the document cannot be recovered. If you want to retain the document for your records, open the Google Doc and change the sharing and owner settings, or create a copy of the document before deleting.
