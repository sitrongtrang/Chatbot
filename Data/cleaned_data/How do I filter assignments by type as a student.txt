How do I filter assignments by type as a student
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Group Assignments by Type
Click the Show By Type button.
View Assignments by Type
Now you can view all the Assignments for the course in the groupings rather than just all at once. You can also see how much each grouping will be worth in the final grade.
