How do I view global activity for all my courses in the Recent Activity Dashboard as a student
Open Dashboard
In Global Navigation, click the Dashboard link.
Open Global Activity Stream
Click the Options icon and then click the Recent Activity link. 
View Global Activity
The Global Activity Stream contains recent notifications from all of your courses, including announcements, discussions, assignments, and conversations. This activity stream helps you see all recent activity in your courses and easily ask questions and post to discussion forums. Unlike course cards, the activity stream does not mimic the visibility of Course Navigation links. 
Activities are indicated by activity type and display an icon for the activity. Each activity also includes the name of its associated course. 
New activity in your account is indicated by an unread icon. Discussions and Announcements indicate new activity items published in a course, and Conversations indicate a new message received from a user in a course. Recent Activity items remain for four weeks.
Expand and Collapse Notifications
You can view the details of each activity by hovering in the notification area and clicking the Show More link. To collapse recent activity, click the Show Less link.
Manage Recent Activity
You can directly access your recent activities by clicking the course link. To remove a notification, click the remove icon.
