Viewing Canvas courses in the Dashboard
Open Courses List
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link. Then click the All Courses link.
View Courses List
The Courses list displays a list of all courses in which you are enrolled. 
To view a published course, you can click the course name link. You can only access published courses. Unpublished courses do not display a link. 
Note: If your Courses list does not display any courses, you may not be enrolled in a course, course participation may be restricted, or your institution may not have updated the course enrollments in Canvas. Once registered, courses may take up to 24 hours to show in Canvas. You may need to reach out to your Canvas administrator or your instructor for help. 
Select Favorite Courses
You can designate your favorite courses in the Courses list. Favorited courses display in your Canvas Dashboard. 
To favorite a course, click the Favorite icon. Courses with filled stars show the course is a favorite.
Notes:
After you have manually favorited at least one course, Canvas automatically favorites any new published course enrollments for you.
You can only favorite active courses. Courses listed in the Future and Past enrollments list cannot be favorited.
