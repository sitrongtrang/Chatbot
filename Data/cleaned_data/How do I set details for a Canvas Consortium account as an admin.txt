How do I set details for a Canvas Consortium account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Settings
In Account Navigation, click the Settings link.
View Settings
Account Settings defaults to the Settings tab. Here you can view all the details available to you in your account.
View Account Settings
The Account Settings section allows you to specify settings for the entire consortium account, including account name, default language, default time zone, Multi-Factor Authentication and self-enrollment. 
You can also specify trusted URLs at the parent account. This option allows accounts to have custom login pages hosted on different domains but still keep the authenticity token.
You can set a default view for the Dashboard using the Default View for Dashboard drop-down menu. Default options include Recent Activity, List View, and Card View. The setting defaults to the Card View. Specifying a default view applies to all new account users. Once a user has selected a different view, the default no longer applies. If you want to apply the selected default view to all users in the account, click the Overwrite all usersâ€™ existing default dashboard preferences checkbox. However, users can change their dashboard view at any time in the dashboard options menu.
View Maintenance Window
The Default Time Zone settings also display the maintenance windows for your account. You can expect that all maintenance for your account will occur during your maintenance window, unless emergency maintenance is required. Even though the windows are two hours each, your expected downtime shouldn't last for more than a few minutes. It is also possible that maintenance will not be necessary during your scheduled maintenance windows.
You can view the regular cadence when your maintenance windows take place as well as the specific date and time of your next maintenance window.
View Restriction Settings
You can also manage restriction settings for the entire consortium account. 
If you do not want instructors to be able to rename their courses, click the Don't let teachers rename their courses checkbox. 
If you do not want instructors to modify course availability dates, click the Don't let teachers modify course availability dates checkbox. This checkbox does not display in the Account Setting page for child accounts.
To allow students to opt-in to receive scores as part of grading notifications, click the Students can opt-in to receiving scores in email notifications checkbox. When this option is enabled, the user's Notification Settings page displays an opt-in checkbox in the Course Activities Grading section. If you enable this option but disable it at a later time, the checkbox will be removed from the notifications page, and anyone who has opted in will no longer receive scores in grading notifications.
To allow students to be included in global surveys, click the Include students in global surveys checkbox.
If you do not want students to be able to view quiz questions after their course has concluded, click the Restrict students from viewing quiz questions after course end date checkbox. 
You can choose to restrict student access to view courses before the course start date.
If you choose to restrict students from accessing courses before the start date, you can also restrict students from viewing future courses in their enrollments list.
You can also choose to restrict student access to view courses after the course end date.
You can also disable comments on announcements in all courses. 
To allow students to download course content and view content offline for all courses, select the Allow students to download course content and view offline checkbox. Alternatively, if you'd prefer to allow students to download course content and view content offline for specific courses, you can enable the ePub Exporting feature option for the course. 
You can require that copyright and license information be provided for files before they are published.
You can also disable Canvas media uploads in the Rich Content Editor.
You can allow the option to split student names into two separate columns and show first and last names separately in the Gradebook.
Institutions can increase the list of displayed calendars from 10 to 15. This checkbox applies to all users in the account.
Note: Settings managed in the parent account are inherited and locked at the child account.
View Slack API Key
You can add a Slack API key in Account Settings to allow users to receive notifications in Slack. The Slack API Key is generated from an app created using the Slack API. To add a new Slack API key, type the Bot User OAuth Access Token copied from Slack in the New Slack Api Key field.
Learn more about creating a Slack App for your institution.
Note: Creating a Slack App and generating an Access Token requires that you are also an admin user in Slack.
View Personal Pronouns
The Personal Pronouns section allows you to enable and customize personal pronoun options in your account. When enabled, users can select a pronoun to display after their username in several areas in Canvas.
View Quiz IP Address Filters
The Quiz IP Address filter allows an admin to create a predefined list of IP addresses or address ranges, making it easier for instructors to select a valid setting when creating a quiz. Since this is often used by an organization to limit tests to an on-campus testing center, it is recommended that you use a descriptive name that associates your filter with that location.
Filters can be a comma-separated list of addresses, or an address followed by a mask (i.e., 192.168.217.1/24 or 192.168.217.1/255.255.255.0). For more information on these masks, view the IP Filtering in Canvas PDF.

The Similarity Detection Platform section displays for all accounts and is used for plagiarism LTI tool integrations. 
If your account has installed at least one plagiarism LTI tool, any content you include in the Similarity Pledge text field will display to students. Similarity pledges require students to check a box acknowledging they agree with the pledge information, which usually asks them to verify their work is their own and that any sources have been properly cited.
You can also set the originality score default for the entire account in the Students can see originality score drop-down menu. You can set the report to generate immediately upon assignment submission, after an assignment is graded, after an assignment due date, or never. The account default is not required and can be changed at any other level. Subaccounts can set a separate default from the account, and individual assignments within a course can set their own originality preferences as well.

Note: If you enable the Google Apps LTI for your entire consortium, you do not need to enable the Google Drive web service for your students.
