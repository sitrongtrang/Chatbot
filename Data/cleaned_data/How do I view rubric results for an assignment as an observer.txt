How do I view rubric results for an assignment as an observer
Open Grades
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
Note: If a course does not display the Grades link, you can view student grades from the Canvas dashboard. 
Open Rubric
Assignments with a rubric display a rubric icon. To open the rubric, click the Rubric icon.
View Rubric Results
View the rubric results for the assignment. Selected ratings display a rating flag. You can also view the earned points for each criterion, as well as the total earned points
View Non-Scoring Rubric Results
If the instructor has removed points from the rubric, you can still view the rubric results for the assignment.
View Rubric Comments
If the instructor left comments for your student in the rubric, you can view them in the rubric criteria.
Note: Comments only display if an instructor left a comment for the student in the rubric.
