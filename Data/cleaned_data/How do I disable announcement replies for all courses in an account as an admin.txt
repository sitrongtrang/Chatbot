How do I disable announcement replies for all courses in an account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Account Settings
In Account Navigation, click the Settings link.
Disable Comments on Announcements
In the Account Settings tab, locate the announcements options.
To set a default for the entire account so that comments are automatically disabled for announcement comments in each course, click the Disable comments on announcements checkbox. This option applies immediately to new courses. When enabled, all announcements show as closed for comments, but instructors can open individual announcements as necessary. Instructors can open Course Settings and remove the option completely for all new announcements.
If you want to lock the default setting for sub-accounts and courses, click the Lock this setting for sub-accounts and courses checkbox. This option does not allow instructors to open any individual announcements or remove the limitation in Course Settings.
Update Settings
Click the Update Settings button.
