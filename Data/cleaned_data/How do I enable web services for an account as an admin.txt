How do I enable web services for an account as an admin
Open Account
Click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Settings
In Account Navigation, click the Settings link.
View Settings
Account Settings defaults to the Settings tab.
Enable Web Services
In the Enabled Web Services section, check the boxes of the web services you'd like to enable. 
Note: If the Google Apps LTI has been enabled for your entire institution, you do not need to enable the Google Drive web service for your students.
