How do I create a recurring event in my Canvas calendar as an observer
Open Calendar
In Global Navigation, click the Calendar link.
Add Event
To add an event to your calendar, click any calendar date. You can also navigate to view previous or upcoming dates using the Previous and Next icons.
Alternatively, you can click the Add icon.
Add Event Details
Enter a title for the event. 
Depending on how you added your event, the date may be populated for you. If not, enter a date in the date field.
The calendar times may also be populated for you in the From and To fields. Edit or enter the start and end time for your event. To create an all-day event, leave the From and To fields blank so there is no start and end time for your event. 
In the Frequency drop-down menu, you can set recurring calendar events.
If a location is required, enter a location for the event. 
Add Event Frequency
In the Frequency drop-down menu, you can select from multiple recurring options, including no repeat, daily, weekly, monthly, annually, every weekday, or a custom frequency.
Notes: Each frequency selection has an occurrence default:
daily = 365 (days in a year)
weekly = 52 (weeks in a year)
monthly = 12 (months in a year)
annually = 5 (The event will occur for five years)
every weekday = 52 * 5 (weeks in a year * weekdays)
Additionally, users can have a maximum of 400 occurrences.
Add Event Custom Frequency
To create a custom recurring event, select how often the event repeats, which day(s) it repeats on, and when it ends. Click the Done button.
Submit Event
Click the Submit button.
