How do I use Chat as an instructor
Open Chat
In Course Navigation, click the Chat link.
View Chat
When you open the Chat page, you immediately join the chat. Chat discussion appears in the content window. 
To receive audio alerts for new chat messages, click the New message alerts button. You will receive audio alerts if Chat is open in Canvas but is not the active browser window. You will not receive alerts if you leave Chat to view another area in Canvas. 
Message history for each course is included in the chat. Chat history can be accessed indefinitely by loading more results and scrolling through previous course chats.
Note: Alert capabilities may vary between browsers.
View Online Users
Chat displays the number of users who are in the chat. To view a list of these users, hover your cursor over the number.
View Time Stamp
When a user sends multiple chat messages without another user sending a message, all messages will appear under the first message's time stamp. To view additional time stamps, hover your cursor over the message. 
Send Message
To send a chat message, enter your message in the chat window. To add an emoji to your message, click the Emoji icon. Then click the Send button.
Delete Message
You can delete messages in the chat from any user.
To delete a chat message, hover your cursor over the message and click the Delete icon.
Note: Deleting messages is permanent. You cannot restore a deleted message.
