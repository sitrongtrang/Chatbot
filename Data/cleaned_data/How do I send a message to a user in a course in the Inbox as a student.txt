How do I send a message to a user in a course in the Inbox as a student
Open Inbox
In Global Navigation, click the Inbox link.
Compose Message
Click the Compose icon.
Select Course
In the Course drop-down menu, select the course where you want to send your message. 
Add User
Search for the user in the To field. Alternatively, you can locate and select a user by clicking the Course Roster button.
Search for User
To search for a user, type the user's name in the To field. Select the user's name from the list.
Add Multiple Users
To send a message to multiple users, add names of the users in the To field.
You can send an individual message to each recipient by clicking the Send an individual message to each recipient checkbox.
Use Address Book
To add a user from the course roster, click the Address Book button. Select the role of the user you'd like to add. Then select the user's name. Names are listed in alphabetical order by last name. 
To add multiple users to your message, press the command key (Mac) or the control key (Windows) and click the name of the applicable users.
To navigate back to the course roster, click the Back option.
Send Message
In the subject line field, enter a subject line for your message.
If you are sending your message to multiple users, but you do not want each user to see who else was included in the message, click the Send an individual message to each recipient checkbox. If your message includes over 100 recipients (including you as the sender), this checkbox will be selected by default.
In the message field, type your message. All content is sent in plain text. URLs included in a message automatically become clickable links after the message is sent. 
To include an attachment or media file, click the Attachment or Media File buttons.
When you are finished, click the Send button.
