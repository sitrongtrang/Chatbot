How do I create a Google Docs collaboration as an instructor
Open Collaborations
In Course Navigation, click the Collaborations link.
Start a New Collaboration
Click the Start a new collaboration button.
Authorize Google
If you have not previously authorized Google Drive access in Canvas, you may be prompted to authorize access. Click the Authorize Google Drive Access button. 
Collaborate Using Google Docs
Click the Collaborate using drop-down menu and select Google Docs.
Create Collaboration Document
To create a collaboration document using Google Docs, you will first need to name the document, create a description, and select collaborators. By default, you can view the list of people in the course and can collaborate with individual or multiple users in the course. You can also click the Groups tab and collaborate with a group. 
Click the Start Collaborating button.
Notes: 
Google Docs allows you to add up to 50 users per collaboration, and all users can view and edit a document at the same time.
Collaborators must have a Google account and will need to authorize Canvas before they can view the collaboration.
You can add multiple groups to a collaboration, but all groups will collaborate in the same document. For group-specific collaborations, consider creating a new collaboration for each group or creating a group collaboration within the group.
Edit Document
View the newly created document in a new browser window.
Note: By default, any collaborator can share the document. The document owner can manage the document's share settings from within the Google Doc.
