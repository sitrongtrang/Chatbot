How do I add a group set in a course as an instructor
Open People
In Course Navigation, click the People link.
Add Group Set
Click the Add Group Set button.
Save Group Set
Name the new group by typing it in the Group Set Name field. 
You can allow self sign-ups by selecting the Allow self sign-up checkbox. 
To manually create groups or create groups using a CSV file, click the I'll create groups later option.
From the drop-down menu, select the Split students by number of groups option.
You can automatically create groups by splitting the students into equal groups or selecting the number of students per group. To split the students into a number of equal groups, select the Split students by [number] groups option in the drop down menu. 
To create groups with a certain number of students, use the arrows or type the number of students per group in the dialog box.
Click the Save button.
Notes: 
Except when creating groups manually, you can automatically set student group leaders. 
The Require group members to be in the same section option is available in self sign-up and automatically created groups.
The maximum number of groups that Canvas can create for an automatically assigned group set is 200. If you ask Canvas to create more than 200 groups, it will only create 200.
