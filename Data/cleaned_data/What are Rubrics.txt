What are Rubrics
Account Rubrics
Account-level rubrics are rubrics that are created at the account or sub-account level. They can be used by any course within that account or sub-account for assignments, discussions, or quizzes. If an account-level rubric is used in more than one place, it becomes uneditable, but is still usable. 
Account-level rubrics can be used to create institutional or departmental question repositories. The purpose of account-level rubrics is to provide resources for teachers, not control content. For example, if the English department offered several courses to teach basic grammar rules to students, a department could create a sub-account level rubric. Instructors could then access the rubric to offer the same evaluation standards to students in different courses. 
Course Rubrics
Course-level rubrics are either created at the course level or copied from the account or sub-account level. Once a rubric has been used to assess a student, the rubric cannot be edited. However, existing rubrics can be recopied and used on other assignments.
