How do I restrict the viewing of quantitative data in a course as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Course Details
Click the Course Details tab.
View Quantitative Data Options
In the Course Details tab, locate the Quantitative Data Options. To restrict students and observers from viewing quantitative data, click the Restrict view of quantitative data checkbox.
By default, the Restrict view of quantitative data checkbox is not selected, meaning students and parents/observers can view numeric data as well as letter grades and comments. To retain this default for the course, do not select the checkbox. 
Note: If the checkbox is selected and grayed out, your admin has locked the account-level setting.
Update Course Details
Click the Update Course Details button.
