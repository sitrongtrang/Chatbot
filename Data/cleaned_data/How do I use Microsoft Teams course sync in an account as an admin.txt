How do I use Microsoft Teams course sync in an account as an admin
Open Settings
In Account Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Integrations
From the Account Settings page, click the Integrations tab.
Enter Microsoft Teams Details
Enter your Azure Active Directory tenant name in the Tenant Name field.
Select the attribute to use when associating a Canvas user with a Microsoft user in the Login Attribute drop-down menu. You can select the user's default Canvas email, unique user ID (such as the user's login_id or Canvas API's pseudonymunique_id), SIS user ID, and integration ID.
If the Suffix field is populated, the entered text attaches to the Login Attribute.
Select the attribute to use to match a Canvas user to a Microsoft user in the Active Directory Lookup Attribute drop-down menu. You can select user principal name (UPN), primary email address (mail), and email alias (mailNickname).
To update the details, click the Update Settings button.
Note: When the Email login attribute is selected, only the user's primary Canvas email address is used in the course sync.
Enable Sync
To enable Microsoft Teams sync in your Canvas account, click the Sync button. Then click the Grant tenant access link.
Log In to Microsoft
Use your Microsoft credentials to log in to your Microsoft Teams account. Logging in to your account grants Canvas access to your Microsoft tenant.
Note: Granting access to your Microsoft tenant should be completed by the Microsoft 365 admin at your institution.
