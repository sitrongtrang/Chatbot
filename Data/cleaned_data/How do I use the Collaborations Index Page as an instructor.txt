How do I use the Collaborations Index Page as an instructor
Open Collaborations
In Course Navigation, click the Collaborations link.
View Collaborations
The Collaborations page displays all collaborations that have been created for the course. For each collaboration, you can view the name of the collaboration, the description, the person who created the collaboration, and the date and time the collaboration was created.
Add Collaboration
 To create a new collaboration, click the Add Collaboration button.
Depending on your institution's preference, you may be able to create a Google Drive collaboration or create a Microsoft Office 365 collaboration.
If your collaborations page does not match the image shown in this lesson, you can still create a Google Docs collaboration.

Note: The collaboration will open in a new tab. You may be asked to sign in to view the file.
Manage Collaborations
