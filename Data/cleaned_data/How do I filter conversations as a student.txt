How do I filter conversations as a student
Open Inbox
In Global Navigation, click the Inbox link.
Filter by Course
You can filter your inbox by types of courses. Your Inbox may contain the following options: 
Current courses in your Favorites menu 
Other courses that you haven't favorited
Concluded courses 
Current or concluded groups
Note: You cannot send messages to users in concluded courses.
Filter by Inbox
You can also filter by Inbox type. By default, the Inbox displays all messages.
View Unread Messages
The Unread filter displays all unread conversations in your Inbox. Learn how to view and manage unread messages.
View Starred Messages
The Starred filter displays all starred messages in your Inbox. Starred messages are marked as important so you can locate them later. Learn how to star a message.
View Sent Messages
The Sent filter displays all your sent messages, both to individual users or multiple users. 
Note: The Sent filter only includes sent messages from the first user to send a message in a conversation thread. Replies from recipients of the original message will appear in their Inboxes, but not in their Sent filters.
View Archived Conversations
The Archived filter displays all archived conversations. Learn how to archive a conversation. 
Note: Sent messages cannot be archived. Additionally, archived messages do not include deleted messages, which are completely removed from the Inbox.
View Submission Comments
The Submission Comments filter displays all comments associated with course assignments and feedback. Learn how to reply to submission comments.
Filter by User
To filter by user, type the name of a user in the search field, or browse for the course, group, or user by selecting the Address Book icon.
