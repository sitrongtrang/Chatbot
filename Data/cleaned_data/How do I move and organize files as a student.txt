How do I move and organize files as a student
Move File via Move Button or Options Icon
In user or group files, locate the file you want to move. Click the line item for the file.
To move the file via the toolbar, click the Move button. 
To move the file via file settings, click the Options icon, then click the Move link. 
Select the folder where you want to move the file and click the Move button.
Move File via Drag and Drop
You can also manage your files using a basic click-and-drag method. Click the file name and drag the file to the desired folder. Once you see the folder highlighted, release your mouse. The file has been moved. 
You can also move a file from the right pane to the left pane. 
Note: You can only move a file within the right pane or from the right pane to the left pane. Files are organized in alphabetical order. While you can still move files into folders, you cannot rearrange the alphabetized structure of the files and folders. 
Move Multiple Files
To select multiple files, press the command key (Mac) or the control key (Windows) while clicking the line for each file you want to select.
To select all files, click the command + A keys (Mac) or the control + A keys (Windows).
To select a range of files click the first file you want to select, hold down the Shift key, and then click the last file you want to select. All files between the first and the last file will be selected.
Note: You can also use the same key command to deselect a file.
