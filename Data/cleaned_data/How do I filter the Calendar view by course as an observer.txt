How do I filter the Calendar view by course as an observer
Open Calendar
In Global Navigation, click the Calendar link.
View Calendar
The Calendar page displays your Canvas user calendar as well as calendars for courses in which you are enrolled. 
Select Displayed Calendars
You can select specific calendars to display in the Canvas Calendar. In the sidebar, select the calendars you want to display. The Calendar page can display events and assignments for up to 10 courses at a time. 
Selected calendars display a filled box next to the calendar name. 
Deselected calendars display an empty square.
Customize Calendar Color
Canvas assigns an arbitrary color for each course calendar. However, you can select a custom color for each course. Click the calendar More icon. 
Select one fo the fifteen default colors, or enter a hex code for a custom color. To apply your calendar customizations, click the Apply button.
