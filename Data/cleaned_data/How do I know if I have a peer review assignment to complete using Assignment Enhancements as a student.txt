How do I know if I have a peer review assignment to complete using Assignment Enhancements as a student
View Dashboard
Once a peer review is assigned to you, a notification appears in several dashboard areas.

On your Dashboard, you can view recent activity in your Global Activity stream. Recent activity displays a peer review and the name of the course. Click the Show More link to access the assignment and view the name of the peer review student. 
If a peer review is anonymous, the name will show as Anonymous User.
