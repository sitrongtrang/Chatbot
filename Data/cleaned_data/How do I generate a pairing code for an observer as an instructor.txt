How do I generate a pairing code for an observer as an instructor
Open People
In Course Navigation, click the People link.
Open User Details
Click the student's Options icon, then select the User Details link.
Pair with Observer
Click the Pair with Observer link.
Note: If you cannot view the Pair with Observer link, the permission to generate pairing codes has not been enabled for your role, or self-enrollment has not been enabled for your course.
Copy Pairing Code
Confirm the name of the student.
Copy the six-digit alphanumeric pairing code. You will need to share this code with the observer who will link to the student's account. The pairing code will expire after seven days or its first use.
To close the window, click the OK button.
Note: Pairing codes are case sensitive.
Export Pairing Codes
You can also export a list of new pairing codes for all students in your course. Click the Options icon, then select the Export Pairing Codes link. Canvas exports a CSV file with one pairing code for each student in your course.
View Pairing Codes
Locate and open the pairing codes CSV file on your computer. The CSV file displays the first and last name of each student, the student's SIS ID, the student's pairing code, and the date and time at which the pairing code will expire.
