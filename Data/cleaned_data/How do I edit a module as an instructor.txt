How do I edit a module as an instructor
Open Modules
In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
Edit Module
Locate the name of the module and click the Options icon. Select the Edit link.
Edit Module Settings
Edit the module settings you want to change. You can rename the module, lock modules, add prerequisites, add requirements, and require students to move through module items in order. 
Note: The Students must move through requirements in sequential order checkbox will not be shown if the Students must complete one of these requirements radio button is selected.
Update Module
When you are ready to save your Module changes, click the Update Module button.
Re-Lock Module
If you change any module requirements or prerequisites that students have already fulfilled, Canvas will ask if you want to let students progress through the course or re-lock the modules and require students to complete the requirements again.
To re-lock the modules, click the Re-Lock Modules button. To allow students to continue without any changes, click the Continue button.
