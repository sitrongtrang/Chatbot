How do I create an assignment shell in an assignment group as an instructor
Open Assignments 
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Add Assignment
In an assignment group header, click the Add icon.
Enter Assignment Details
Set the Assignment type by selecting the type drop-down menu, enter the Assignment title in the Name field, click the Calendar icon to select a due date or manually enter a due date, and enter the number of points for the assignment in the points field. 
If your institution has enabled a student information system (SIS) integration, you can enable the assignment to sync to the SIS by selecting the Sync to SIS checkbox.
Save Assignment
To edit the assignment details, click the More Options button. 
If you want to save your assignment shell and edit the details later, click the Save button.
View Due Date Error
Due dates are verified against course data. If you have set a due date that is not allowed, Canvas displays information about the error.
Correct the date and then save the assignment again. 
Note: If the error relates to a course end date, and the course does not include specified course start and end dates, Canvas validates the assignment against the term date for the course.
