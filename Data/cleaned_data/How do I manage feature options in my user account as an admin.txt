How do I manage feature options in my user account as an admin
Open User Settings
In Global Navigation, click the Account link, then click the Settings link. 
View Feature Settings
Available features appear in the Feature Settings section. 
Filter Feature Options
To filter by all features, enabled features or disabled features, click the Filter drop-down menu.
Search Feature Settings
To search for a feature setting, type a keyword in the Search field. 
View Types of Features
Each feature includes a feature description. To expand the feature box and display the description, click the arrow icon.
View Feature Tags
Feature tags help identify the state of each feature. 
A feature with no label means the feature is stable and ready for use in your production environment. 
Features may also include a beta tag, which means the feature is available for use in your production environment but is still being tested for usability and accessibility behavior. Enabling a beta feature may create unintended behavior within your Canvas account.
Note: Occasionally features may include a Development tag, which means the feature is only available for testing in your beta environment; it is not available in your production environment. Not all institutions allow testing in beta environments.
View Feature States
You can choose to enable or disable feature settings.
To enable or disable a feature, click the feature's State icon. 
To turn the feature on, click the Enabled option. Enabled features display the Enabled icon.
To turn the feature off, click the Disabled option. Disabled features display the Disabled icon.
