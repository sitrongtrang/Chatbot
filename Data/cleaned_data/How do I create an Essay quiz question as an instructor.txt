How do I create an Essay quiz question as an instructor
Add Question
With the Questions tab selected inside a new quiz, click the New Question button.
Set Name, Type, and Points
Quiz questions are not automatically numbered for instructors. To add a custom name to your quiz question, enter the name in the question text field. Custom names can help you identify quiz questions more easily. Regardless of the question name, students always see quiz questions in numerical order (i.e. Question 1, Question 2).
Click the drop-down menu and select the Essay question type.
Enter number of points the question is worth (quiz totals are calculated based on combined total of questions).
Note: Quiz point values support up to two decimal places. Entering more than two decimal places will round the point value to the nearest hundredth.
Edit Essay Question Details
To build an Essay question, you will need to enter the following details:
The question text (use the Rich Content Editor to include video, images, math equations, or flash activities)
Text for the general answer comment at the end of the question
Note: Any general answer comments are visible as soon as a quiz is submitted and cannot be hidden from students.
Update Question
Click the Update Question button.
Add additional individual questions as needed. 
Student View for Essay Question
This is what a student sees when they encounter a Essay question in a quiz. Students can use the Rich Content Editor to enter text, images, and video content as their response.
Student View for Essay Feedback
After submitting the quiz, students will see their essay answer. 
Notice the answer comment reminds students that their quiz grade will be incomplete until you have manually graded the essay question.
Note: No credit will be assigned until you have evaluated the essay and assigned points in the Gradebook or SpeedGrader.
