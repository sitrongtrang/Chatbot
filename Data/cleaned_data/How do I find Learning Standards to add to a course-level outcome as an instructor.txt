How do I find Learning Standards to add to a course-level outcome as an instructor
Open Outcomes
In Course Navigation, click the Outcomes link.
Find Outcomes
Click the Find button.
Click on the folder that includes the standards you need.
Note: If the Common Core group is not available to you, please contact your Canvas Administrator.
Choose Outcomes
Account and Common Core Standards are nested outcomes, so you can import entire outcome groups into your course, or view all nested outcome groups to locate an individual standard. 
Select the name of an outcome group to view available outcomes. When you have located an outcome, click the name of the outcome you want to import. Click the Import button.
