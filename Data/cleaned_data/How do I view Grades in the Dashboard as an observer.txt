How do I view Grades in the Dashboard as an observer
Open Grades
In the Dashboard sidebar, click the View Grades button. 
View Courses
The Linked Student Accounts heading displays the name of each student and their linked courses, as well as their current overall grade.. If no grades have been assigned, the grade appears as no grade. 
To view grading details for a student in a course, click the student name and course link.
Notes: 
Your student's instructor may restrict you from viewing grade totals.
If enabled by your student's institution, you may only have the ability to view qualitative data, such as letter grades and grading comments.
View Grading Periods
If your student's course is using multiple grading periods, the course displays the name and grade of the current grading period. To view grades for another grading period, click the grading period drop-down menu.
Note: Your instructor may restrict you from viewing grade totals.
