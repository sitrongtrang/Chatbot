How do I view a course as a test student using Student View as an instructor
Open Student View
You can access Student View from most areas of the course including: Home, Modules, Assignments, Announcements, Discussions, Quizzes, Pages, Syllabus, and Outcomes. 
To view the page as a test student, click the View as Student button.
View Course
You can now view the course as a student user would see it. For example, students cannot see the Settings navigation link like instructors can.
You will know if you are in Student View because of the persistent box on the bottom of the screen indicating you are logged into Student View.
Reset Student
You can also reset the Test Student by clicking Reset Student. This action will clear all activity that does not include any student interaction.
For example, if you created an assignment and submitted it as the Test Student but then forgot to add a certain submission type, you can click the Reset Student button and submit the assignment again as the Test Student. 
Leave Student View
To return to your course in the instructor view, click the Leave Student View button.
