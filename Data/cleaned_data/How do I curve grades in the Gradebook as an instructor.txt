How do I curve grades in the Gradebook as an instructor
Open Gradebook
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
Open Assignment Menu
Hover over the assignment column header and click the Options icon.
Curve Grades
Click the Curve Grades link.
Set Curve Score
In the Average Score field, type the average grade for the curve score. The graph above the Average Score field will change depending on what score is entered and give you an approximation of what the new scores would look like. You can adjust the average score as necessary to produce a desired grading outcome. 
You can assign zeros to students who did not submit their assignments by clicking the Assign zeroes to unsubmitted students checkbox. To curve grades, click the Curve Grades button. 
Note:
Grade curving cannot be undone. Pre-curved grade histories will be available, but the curving action is irreversible. 
Student grades will be impacted differently based on where they are in the distribution of scores.
