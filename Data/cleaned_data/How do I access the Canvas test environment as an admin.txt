How do I access the Canvas test environment as an admin
Access Your Test Environment
To log into your test environment, type [organization name].test.instructure.com into the URL field. 
View Test Installation Message
Users in the test environment will see the Test Installation bar across the bottom of the screen indicating the user is in a Canvas Test Installation. Test environments are reset every month after the production release, and any changes you make in your test environment will be reset. If you want to save any course content created in your test environment, you can export your course. 
Note: To hide the Test Installation bar, click the close icon.
Manage Canvas Features
Some new features may be released as opt-in only and will not appear until you enable them in your test environment. You can view these features by clicking the Settings link and clicking the Feature Options tab.
