What user enrollment and registration options are available in Canvas
Self Enrollment
Self-enrollment is an open enrollment method that allows students to use a secret URL or code to join a course. This option requires students to have an existing Canvas accountâ€”most institutions automatically create Canvas accounts for each student through SIS import. 
If you enable self enrollment for an account, instructors can allow self-enrollment for their course in Course Settings to generate the secret URL or code to send to students. 
Instructors can also add a link to the course home page for students to join the course at any time. This option also works well for courses added to the Public Course Index.
Self Registration
Self registration is an authentication method through Canvas that allows users without an account to create an account for themselves. 
If you enable self registration but students do not have a Canvas account, self registration allows them to create their own account to log in to Canvas and join the course. 
Open Registration
Open registration allows students to be added to a course, even if the students don't have a Canvas account in your institution. Students will create their account during the course enrollment process. 
You can enable open registration in your account settings.
