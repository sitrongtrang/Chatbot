How do I delete a course as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Permanently Delete Course
Click the Delete this Course link.
Note: Deleting a course is a permission enabled by your admin. If you do not see this button, you do not have permission to delete your course.
Delete Course
Click the Delete Course button.
Note: Before you delete your course, make sure you have a record of your Course ID number. Administrators can restore deleted courses if they know the Course ID number. You can locate your Course ID number at the end of your course URL (i.e. canvas.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXX).
