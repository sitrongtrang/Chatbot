How do I set storage quotas for an account as an admin
Open Account
Click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Settings
The settings portion of your account is only available to Canvas admins. 
In Account Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Quotas
Click the Quotas tab.
View Default Account Quotas
In the Default Account Quota section, you can view the default quotas assigned to each course, user, and group.
To change quotas, type a new number in the quota fields. Changing the quota will change the quotas for courses, users, and/or groups for the entire account. 
Click the Update button.
Note: Sub-account admins cannot manage user quotas.
Find Manually Settable Quotas
In the Manually Settable Quotas section, you can search for a course or group with a specific quota. In the ID field, select Course ID or Group ID. In the text field, enter the ID of the course or group. Click the Find button. 
Notes: 
The course ID is located at the end of your course URL (i.e. canvas.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXXâ€©, and the group ID is located at the end of the URL (i.e. canvas.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXX/groups/XXXXX). 
Manually Settable Quotas at parent level only apply to its own sub-accounts/courses
