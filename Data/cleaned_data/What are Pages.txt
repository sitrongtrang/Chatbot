What are Pages
Instructor View
In a course, instructors can create a new page with text, images, media, links, and/or other files. 
The Options icon allows instructors to edit the title of a page, delete a page, use it as the front page, duplicate the page, send a copy of the page to another instructor at their institution, or copy the page to one of their other courses. 
The Delete button allows instructors to delete selected pages.
Student View
Students can view pages in courses. However, instructors can allow students to edit and contribute to course pages. Students can always create pages in their student group.
In groups, students can view the same page layout with the name of the page, creation dates, and edit dates. They can also add new pages in a group. In the Options icon, they can edit, delete, or use a page as the front page for a group. Students can use the Delete button to delete selected pages for a group.
