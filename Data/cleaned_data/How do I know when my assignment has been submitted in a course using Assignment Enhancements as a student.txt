How do I know when my assignment has been submitted in a course using Assignment Enhancements as a student
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link. 
Open Assignment
Click the assignment name. 
View Assignment Status
The Progress Tracker displays the assignment submission status. A successfully submitted assignment displays a Submitted status.
Additionally, you can view your most recent submission.
If you choose, you may resubmit another version of your assignment using the New Attempt button.
If you've submitted multiple assignment submissions, you can view previous submissions by clicking the Attempt drop-down.
To add an assignment comment for your instructor, click the Add Comment button.
Notes: 
If you're not able to resubmit work, your instructor may have limited the number of allowed submissions or the assignment may no longer be accepting submissions due to the assignment's availability dates.
Once you've submitted your work, the assignment will still display in the Assignments page and the Syllabus.
View Assignment Score
If your assignment has been graded by your instructor, you can view the score for each attempt in the Attempt Score field. If your assignment has been graded without a submission, you can view your score in the Offline Score field.
