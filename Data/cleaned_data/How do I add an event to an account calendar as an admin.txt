How do I add an event to an account calendar as an admin
Open Calendar
In Global Navigation, click the Calendar link.
Add Account Calendar
Click the Add icon.
To add additional calendar(s) to your Canvas calendar, click the checkbox next to the calendar and click the Save Changes button.
Add Event
Click any date on the calendar to add an event. Or, click the arrows next to the month name to navigate to a different month and select a date.
If you don't want to manually locate the date, you can click the Add icon.
Add Event Details
Enter a title for the event. 
Depending on how you added your event, the date may be populated for you. If not, enter a date in the date field.
The calendar times may also be populated for you in the From fields. To edit, use the dropdown or enter the start and end time for your event. To create an all-day event, leave the From fields blank so there is no start and end time for your event. 
In the Frequency drop-down menu, you can set recurring calendar events.
You can enter a location.
In the Calendar drop-down menu, select the account calendar.
Submit Event
To add additional details to your event, click the More Options button. You can use the Rich Content Editor to add a description or resource links and add an address location.
If you only want to create the event as a placeholder and add details later, click the Submit button. You can edit your event at any time.
