If student grades and submission comments are already hidden, the Options menu displays that all grades are hidden. To post student grades, click the Post grades link.
If there are no grades on the assignment, the Options menu will display that there are no grades to hide or post.
Select Sections
To hide grades for specific sections, click the Specific Sections button. Then select the sections where you want to hide grades.
Note: You cannot hide grades for specific sections in anonymous assignments.
Hide Grades
Click the Hide button.
View Gradebook
Assignments with hidden grades display the Visibility icon. 
A Visibility icon also displays in the students' Total column. This indicates that the final grade differs from the final grade that students can view in their Grades page.
To post assignment grades, click the assignment's Options icon.
Notes: 
The Total column only displays graded assignments that have been hidden. Assignments that are set as Not Graded are not affected.
Viewing the Total Column in the Gradebook may be restricted when multiple grading periods are enabled.
