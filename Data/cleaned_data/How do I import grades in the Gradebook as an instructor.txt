How do I import grades in the Gradebook as an instructor
Create CSV File
For new files, save the file as Grades-Course_Name.csv. 
Required columns and order
Student Name
Student ID
SIS User ID (only required if you use SIS)
SIS Login ID (only required if you use SIS)
Section
Assignment (this can be for an existing assignment or a new assignment; retain IDs for existing assignments)
Note: If you don't want to create a new CSV file, you can always download the CSV from Canvas, change it, and re-upload the same file and the changes you made will appear in Canvas once you re-upload the CSV file.
Open Gradebook
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
Upload Scores
Click the Import button.
Choose File
Click the Choose File or Browse button (depending on your browser).
Open File
Locate the CSV file then click the Open button.
Upload Data
Click the Upload Data button.
Upload New Data
If you add a new column to the CSV file and then upload the file, Canvas will ask you what you want to do with the new column. In the drop-down menu, choose the A new assignment option. Then assign the number of points possible. Click the Continue button.
Notes: 
When multiple grading periods is enabled, CSV file uploads cannot create new assignments.
New assignments created via a CSV file upload are automatically published and maintain the course posting policy.
Save Changes
Review the changes made to your Gradebook. Any changes that will result in a lower grade than the previous version are highlighted in red.
If you upload assignments with no grade changes, they will be hidden from the upload. 
Click the Save Changes button.
