How do I switch groups as a student
Open People
In Course Navigation, click the People link.
Note: If your instructor has disabled the People link in Course Navigation, you cannot switch groups. 
Open Groups
Click the Groups tab.
Or, to open your groups from the Options menu, click the Options icon and then click the View User Groups link.
Switch Groups
When multiple groups are within the same group set, you can switch groups to simultaneously leave your current group and join another group in the set. 
To switch to another group in the set, click the group Switch To button.
Verify Group Removal
A message appears at the top of your browser verifying you joined the other group. 
You are now a member of the group you switched to and you have left the other group.
