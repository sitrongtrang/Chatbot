What are Mastery Paths
Instructor View
Instructors create and manage Mastery Paths in the course Modules page. 
Any graded assignment, graded discussion, or graded quiz may be used as the source content for a Mastery Path. A student's source content score determines their next assignment(s).
Note: Before building Mastery Paths in the Modules page, instructors should create or add all course assignments, activities, and pages, and then add them in modules. Learn more about creating Mastery Paths in course modules. 
Source Content Learning Paths
For each source assignment, instructors add conditional content within scoring ranges. Conditional items and requirements can vary for each scoring range. 
Note: To differentiate an assignment for students based on scoring ranges, instructors must also assign conditional content items to Mastery Paths . 
Mastery Paths Breakdowns
Once students complete source assignments, instructors can view Mastery Paths range breakdowns that show the number of students who scored in each range. 
Student View
When students view course modules in a Mastery Path course, they may see that module items are restricted until source assignments are graded. When unlocked, students may be able to choose their learning path assignments.
