How do I manage content for a course associated with a blueprint course as an instructor
Open Course
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link, then click the name of the course.
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Note: Blueprint objects can also be viewed in the Files, Modules, Pages, and Quizzes pages.
View Object Icons
In any Index page, you can view the status of each object. White squares indicate the object is unlocked. Squares with a lock icon indicate the object is locked. The hover text also confirms the status of the object.
View Object with No Icon
Any new content you create in your course does not include a blueprint icon and cannot be associated with the blueprint course.
View Status in Individual Object
Except within Files, blueprint status and locked attributes can be viewed within individual objects.
Files status can only be viewed in the Files Index Page.
View Unlocked Object
Objects that are unlocked can be edited, published, and managed like any other Canvas object. The only difference is that the page designates that the object is part of a blueprint course. 
You can modify unlocked content at any time. Any unlocked content that you modify will not be overwritten with additional synced changes from the blueprint course.
Note: New content that you create in your course is not associated with the blueprint course and will not display the Blueprint designation. 
View Locked Object
For locked objects, the individual page displays the locked attributes as set by your institution.
Attributes that can be locked include content (including the object title), points, due dates, and availability dates.
Edit Locked Object
When you edit content in a locked object, locked attributes cannot be edited.
