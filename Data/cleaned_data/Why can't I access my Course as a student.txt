Why can't I access my Course as a student
If you are self-enrolling in a course using a join code or URL, you may not have completed the registration process. Check your email for information from your instructor as to how to enroll in your course. 
If your institution enrolled you in your course, your enrollment may not have been set up properly. Please contact your instructor(s) for assistance.
Each course is associated with a specific participation date. Depending on the date associated with the course, you may not yet be able to view your course.
Courses must be published by your institution before you can access them. If a course is not accessible to you in your course list, it may not be published. 
Access to concluded courses may be restricted by your institution.
