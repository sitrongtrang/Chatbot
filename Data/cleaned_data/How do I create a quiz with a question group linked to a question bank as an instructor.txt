Add New Question Group
Click the Questions tab. Click the New Question Group button.
Create Group Details
Give your question group a name. Decide how many questions you want Canvas to randomly select from the group and the number of points assigned to each question. 
Quiz question groups are not automatically named for instructors. To add a custom name to your quiz question group, enter the name in the group text field. Custom names can help you identify quiz question groups more easily.
Regardless of the question group name, students always see quiz questions in numerical order (i.e. Question 1, Question 2).
Note: 
Quiz point values support up to two decimal places. Entering more than two decimal places will round the point value to the nearest hundredth.
If you set a question group to randomly select questions from the question bank, the question bank and questions will not be included in quiz exports. The QTI file will download quiz details, but no questions will be included.
