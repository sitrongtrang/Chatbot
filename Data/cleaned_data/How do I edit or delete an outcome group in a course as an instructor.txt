How do I edit or delete an outcome group in a course as an instructor
Open Outcomes
In Course Navigation, click the Outcomes link.
Select Outcome Group
Locate the outcome group you want to modify.
Modify Outcome Group
To edit an outcome group, click the Edit button. Editing an outcome group lets you change the outcome name and description as set when creating an outcome group.
To delete an outcome group, click the Delete button. 
Note: If you delete an outcome group and the outcome group generates an error, your outcome group contains an outcome that cannot be modified. Move the outcome to another outcome group, then try deleting the outcome group again.
