How do I view survey results in a course as an instructor
Open Quizzes
In Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link.
Open Survey
Click the Survey name.
Show Student Survey Results
Click the Options icon and select the Show Student Survey Results link to view individual submissions.
Select Student Survey Result
Under the Students who have taken the quiz heading, click the name of a student. You can also see a list of students who haven't taken the practice quiz. The warning icon indicates a submission that needs review.
Open Survey Statistics
In the sidebar, click the Survey Statistics link to view all the responses to the Survey.
Note: To view responses to essay questions, view individual submissions or download the Student Analysis CSV.
View and Filter Statistics
View the Survey statistics. You can view an entire summary that shows all score percentages. The summary also shows the quiz average score, high score, low score, standard deviation (how far the values are spread across the entire score range), and average time of completion.
To filter Survey statistics, click the Section Filter button and choose the section that you would like to view. Note that you can only view the first 10 sections of your course. To access additional Survey results, generate a Student Analysis report.
View Student Analysis Report
Like quiz statistics, you can also download Survey results by clicking the Student Analysis button.
Note: By default, the submitted time in the Student Analysis report is shown in UTC, not your set time zone.
