How do I create a new ePortfolio as an instructor
Open ePortfolios
In Global Navigation, click the Account link, then click the ePortfolios link. 
Create an ePortfolio
Click the Create an ePortfolio button.
Notes: 
You must be enrolled in a course to create a new ePortfolio. 
If the Create an ePortfolio button does not display, you may have an ePortfolio that has been marked as spam. Contact your Canvas administrator for further assistance.
Create ePortfolio
Name your ePortfolio by typing in the ePortfolio Name field. Decide if your ePortfolio will be public (you can change this setting later) and then click on the Make ePortfolio button.
View ePortfolio
Once the ePortfolio is created, there are several options for creating content for your portfolio, including a wizard that will walk you through your creation, step by step.
View Warning Message
If your ePortfolio has been marked as spam, a warning message will display in your ePortfolio. You will be unable to edit your ePortfolio until a Canvas administrator marks the ePortfolio as safe. Additionally, you will not be able to create any new ePortfolios until a Canvas administrator marks the ePortfolio as safe.
Edit ePortfolio
To edit your ePortfolio settings, click the ePortfolio Settings link. 
Update ePortfolio
Edit the ePortfolio name or visibility option in ePortfolio Settings. Click the Update ePortfolio button.
