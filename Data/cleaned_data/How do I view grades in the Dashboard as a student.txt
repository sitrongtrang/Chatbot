How do I view grades in the Dashboard as a student
Open Grades
In the Dashboard sidebar, click the View Grades button. 
View Courses
The Courses I'm Taking heading displays the name of each course and a current overall grade, if available. If no grades have been assigned, the grade appears as no grade. 
To view grading details, click the name of the course.
Notes: 
Your instructor may restrict you from viewing grade totals.
If enabled by your institution, you may only have the ability to view qualitative data, such as letter grades and grading comments.
View Grading Periods
If your course is using multiple grading periods, the course displays the name and grade of the current grading period. To view grades for another grading period, click the grading period drop-down menu.
Note: Your instructor may restrict you from viewing grade totals.
