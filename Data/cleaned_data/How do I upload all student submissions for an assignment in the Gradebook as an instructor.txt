Canvas will confirm your files have been uploaded and associated with student submissions. If any files were ignored in the upload, those files will also be listed.
Note: Depending on your computer's operating system, your upload may include hidden files with a ._ prefix. Canvas will ignore these types of files, as well as any files that do not match the file name of any students' original submission.
