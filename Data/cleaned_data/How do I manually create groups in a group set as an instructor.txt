How do I manually create groups in a group set as an instructor
Open People
In Course Navigation, click the People link.
Add Group Set
Click the Add Group Set button. 
Save Group Set
Add a Group Set Name. Select whether you would like to allow self sign-up. Make sure the Create groups later option is selected from the Group Structure drop-down menu. Then click the Save button. 
Add Group
Click the Add Group button.
Save Group
Name the group by typing in the Group Name field. If you want to limit groups to a specific size, enter the maximum number of group members in the Group Membership Limit field. Click the Save button.
Note: If your group set allows self sign-up and you set a group limit for the entire group set, the group limit will apply to each individual group you create. The option above allows you to modify the limitations within an individual group, such as changing one group to allow a few more members than the other groups. However, at a later time if you decide to edit the entire group set and change the group set limitations, Canvas will override all member limitations created within individual groups. 
View Group
To create another group, click the Add Group button. You can create as many groups as you need. You can keep track of the groups by locating the groups counter.
Students can be assigned to groups manually, automatically, or by importing a CSV file. 
Manage Group
To manage a group, click the group Options menu. To edit the name of the group, click the Edit link. To delete the group, click the Delete link.
