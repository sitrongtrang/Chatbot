How can I manage support tickets for my institution
Send Tickets to Our Ticketing System
Sending tickets to the Canvas Support system (Service Cloud) is the default destination.
If working in the same ticket system as Canvas Support works for you, then you're welcome to use this option. Learn how to log in to Service Cloud.
The Zendesk and Service Cloud Connectors
You can use your own instance of Zendesk or Service Cloud with custom built API-based connectors for Canvas. This option allows use of the metadata from Canvas with every ticket. You can also take advantage of the analytic features.
The Email and Web Post Connectors
You can convert email or web post connectors to tickets to your own ticketing system, even if you are not using Zendesk or Service Cloud.
