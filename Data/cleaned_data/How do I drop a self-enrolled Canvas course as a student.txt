How do I drop a self-enrolled Canvas course as a student
Open Course
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link, then click the name of the course.
Drop this Course
In the sidebar, click the Drop this Course button. 
Note: You can only drop a self-enrolled Canvas course while it is in progress (between the course start date and end date). Also, if you did not enroll in the course using the given URL or join code, meaning you were manually or automatically added to the course, you will have to ask your teacher or institution to be removed from the course. 
Confirm Un-enrollment
Click the Drop this Course button to un-enroll from the course. You will no longer be able to see the course roster, communicate with people in the course, and see course events or notifications.
