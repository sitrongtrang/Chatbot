How do I automatically assign peer reviews for a discussion as an instructor
Open Discussions
In Course Navigation, click the Discussions link. 
Open Discussion
Click the title of the discussion.
Edit Discussion
Click the Edit button.
Automatically Assign Peer Reviews
Click the Require Peer Reviews checkbox.
Click the Automatically Assign Peer Reviews radio button.
Decide how many Reviews Per User are needed.
In the Assign Reviews field, use the calendar icon to select a date or manually enter a date for when peer reviews will be assigned to students. If left blank, Canvas will use the discussion due date.
Save Discussion
Click the Save button.
Open Peer Reviews
Click the Options icon and then click the Peer Reviews link.
View Assigned Peer Reviews
Canvas will automatically assign a peer review to the student. Assigned peer reviews appear underneath the student names. A check mark indicates a peer review has been completed. A caution triangle indicates a peer review still needs to be completed. 
Note: 
It may take up to one hour for Canvas to assign peer reviews.
If the student has not posted their discussion reply or posts their reply after the due date, the student will not automatically be assigned a peer review and you must manually assign one.
Manage Peer Review
You can also remind students who still need to complete their assigned peer review(s). Peer review reminders are sent as notifications.
To send a reminder, hover your mouse over the assigned peer review and click the Reminder icon. To cancel a peer review, click the Delete icon. 
In the sidebar, you can also assign multiple peer reviews to students who have posted to the discussion but don't already have reviews assigned to them. Enter the number of reviews per user then click the Assign Peer Reviews button.
