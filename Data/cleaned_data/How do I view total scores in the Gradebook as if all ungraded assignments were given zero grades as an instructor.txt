How do I view total scores in the Gradebook as if all ungraded assignments were given zero grades as an instructor
Open Grades
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
Open Gradebook Settings
Click the Settings icon.
View Ungraded as Zero
In the View Options tab, click the View Ungraded as 0 checkbox.
Note: If the View Ungraded as 0 option does not display in your Gradebook, this option has not been enabled by your institution.
View Warning Message
A warning displays to inform you that this setting is a visual change only and does not affect grades for students or other users of this Gradebook.
To proceed and view ungraded assignments with zero grades, click the OK button. To return to the Gradebook, click the Cancel button.
Apply Settings
Click the Apply Settings button.
View Gradebook
The View Ungraded as 0 option displays as a heading in all assignment group columns and the Total column to indicate this feature is turned on in the Gradebook. This indicates that gradebook and assignment group totals display visually as if all ungraded assignments were graded with zero points. Actual student grades are not affected.
Note: The View Ungraded as 0 option will not populate zeros in the Gradebook for student submissions within individual assignments. Only the assignment groups and total columns will visually factor scores of zero into the overall percentages for each student.
Turn Off View Ungraded as Zero
To turn off the View Ungraded as 0 option, click the Settings icon. Then click the View Options tab, and deselect the View Ungraded as 0 checkbox. 
To save your changes, click the Apply Settings button.
