Open Assignment Menu
Hover over the assignment title and click the Options icon.

Additionally, Letter Grade assignments display the grading scheme option.
Note: The Enter Grades as option is not available for complete/incomplete assignment types.

In the assignment column, any existing grades will calculate and display according to your grade display preference.
Enter Grades
For new grades, enter a grade value according to your grading preference as supported: points, percentage, or grading scheme. 
The entered grade will be calculated appropriately and displayed according to the grade display option.
