How do I view course content offline as an ePub file as an instructor
Open User Settings
In Global Navigation, click the Account link, then click the Settings link.
Download Course Content
Click the Download Course Content button.
Generate ePub
View the courses available as ePub exports. To generate an ePub, locate the course and click the Generate ePub link.
Download ePub
Once the export has completed, download the ePub by clicking the Download ePub link. You can upload the ePub file into any eReader for viewing.
If the course includes files that aren't supported in the ePub, click the Download Associated Files link. Associated files download in a ZIP file and contain all unsupported files, such as media files and Microsoft Office documents.
