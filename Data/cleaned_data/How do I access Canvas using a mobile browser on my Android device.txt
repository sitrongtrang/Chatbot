How do I access Canvas using a mobile browser on my Android device
Open Mobile Browser
Tap the icon for your preferred mobile browser.
Note: Mobile browser options will vary per Android device.
Enter Canvas URL
Enter your institution's Canvas URL in the URL field.
Open Using Internet
If you already have the Canvas app installed on your device, a pop-up window will appear asking you whether you want to open Canvas using the Canvas app or the Internet.
Then you will need to tell your device how often to ask for this action:
To have your device never ask again and always open to your browser, select the Always button.
If you regularly use the Canvas app and only want to use your browser sparingly, tap the Just once button.
Log In to Canvas
Enter your Canvas login credentials in the email and password fields. Tap the Log In button.
View Canvas
You can interact with Canvas as you would on the regular web version of Canvas.
