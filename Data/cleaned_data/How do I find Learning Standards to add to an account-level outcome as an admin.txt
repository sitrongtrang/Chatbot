How do I find Learning Standards to add to an account-level outcome as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Outcomes
In Account or Sub-Account Navigation, click the Outcomes link.
Find Outcome
Click the Find button.
Select Outcome Type
To view state standards, click the State Standards outcome group.
To view Common Core standards, click the Common Core Standards outcome group.
Note: If State and Common Core groups are not available to you, please contact your Customer Success Manager.
Choose Outcomes
State and Common Core Standards are nested outcomes, so you can import entire outcome groups into your course, or view all nested outcome groups to locate an individual standard. 
Select the name of an outcome group to view available outcomes. When you have located an outcome, click the name of the outcome you want to import. Click the Import button.
View Outcomes
View the added Outcomes. 
Note: The account or sub-account must have the standards imported first before instructors can find and use them in their courses.
