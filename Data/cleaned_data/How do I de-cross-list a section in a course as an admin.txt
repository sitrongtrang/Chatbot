Click the title of the section you want to de-cross-list.
De-Cross-List This Section
Click the De-Cross-List this Section button.
Click the De-Cross-List This Section button. The section will be moved back to its original course.
Note: If you de-cross-list a section that includes student grades, Canvas will include a message that all grades will no longer be visible. If you need to retain student grades and put them in the original course, you should export the Gradebook and import it into the original course before de-cross-listing the section.
