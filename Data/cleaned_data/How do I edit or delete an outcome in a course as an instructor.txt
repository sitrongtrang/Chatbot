How do I edit or delete an outcome in a course as an instructor
Open Outcomes
In Course Navigation, click the Outcomes link.
Select Outcome
Locate the outcome you want to modify. 
Modify Outcome
To edit an outcome, click the Edit button. Editing an outcome allows you to change non-scoring details such as the name and description. You can also edit scoring details for the outcome including the points rating or scoring method.
When you are finished with your edits, click the Save button.
To delete an outcome, click the Delete button.
View Outcome Edit Confirmation
If you edit an outcome that has been used to assess a student, Canvas displays a message notifying you that your edits will update all outcomes associated with a rubric that has not been assessed.
Click the Save button.
Note: This message only displays for outcomes you modify that have not been used to assess a student. If this confirmation message does not display, the outcome is associated with more than one rubric and edits cannot be updated.
View Assessed Outcome
If an outcome has already been used to assess a student, some modifications may affect student results.
To view any aligned items and student assessments for a particular outcome, click the name of the outcome. These assignments and rubrics may be affected when you edit the outcome.
View Scoring Edits Confirmation
If you are editing scoring details on an outcome that has been used to assess students, Canvas displays a message notifying you that your edits will affect all students previously assessed using the outcome. Scoring changes only affect a student's learning mastery score in the Learning Mastery Gradebook for the edited outcome. When scoring criteria is edited, the learning mastery values scale for assessed rubrics according to the original points possible.
