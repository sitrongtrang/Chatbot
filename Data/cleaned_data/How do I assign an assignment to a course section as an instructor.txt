Add details to the assignment.
Assign Different Dates to Section
By default, Canvas will set your assignment for everyone in your course. To add another section with a different due and availability dates, click the Add button. Then start to type the name of the section in the new Assign to field. Search fields are dynamic, and you can search by any part of the section name. Click the section's name when it appears. Lists are not scrollable.
You can include more than one section in the Assign to field as long as the sections are to be assigned the same due and availability dates. 
Assign to Section Only
To create the assignment that is assigned only to a specific section, click the Remove icon next to the Everyone label.
Start to type the name of a section in the Assign to field. Click the section's name when it appears.
Edit Due and Availability Dates
In the date fields, add your preferred date(s) with the following options:
Due: Set the date and time that the assignment is due. The due date will already be populated for you if you created an assignment shell, but you can change it if necessary. 
Available From: Set the date and time when the assignment will become available.
Until: Set the date and time when the assignment will no longer be available.
Note: Beneath the Due Date and Availability date fields, Canvas will display the time zone date and time according to context. If you manage courses in a time zone other than your local time zone and create or edit a due date for an assignment, the course and local times are displayed for reference.
Remove Dates
You can also delete additional dates by clicking the remove icon next to the appropriate date.
Save and Publish
If you are ready to publish your assignment, click the Save & Publish button. If you want to create a draft of your assignment and publish it later, click the Save button.
View Due Date Warning
If you do not add all course sections to the assignment, you will see a warning message asking you if you want to add those sections. 
You can click the Continue button if you don't want to add any other sections to the assignment, or click the Go Back button to go back and add additional sections. 
Note: This warning message will not appear if everyone or all course sections are assigned to the assignment.
View Date Error
If you submit an invalid string of due dates and try to save the assignment, Canvas generates an error notification. Such invalid entries include not unlocking the assignment before it is due, not placing the due date inside the range of availability dates, or assigning a date that is outside the course or term dates. 
Correct the date and then update the assignment again. 
Notes: 
If the course does not include specified course start and end dates, Canvas validates the assignment against the term date set for the course.
If your course is using Multiple Grading Periods, the Assign field validates the due date against the closed grading period and requires the assignment date to be past the date of the closed grading period.
