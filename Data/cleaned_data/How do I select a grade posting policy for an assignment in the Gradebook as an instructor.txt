How do I select a grade posting policy for an assignment in the Gradebook as an instructor
Open Gradebook
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
Open Assignment Menu
Hover over the assignment column header and click the Options icon.
Open Posting Policy
Click the Grade Posting Policy link.
Post Grades Automatically
To post grades automatically, select the Automatically option. When the Automatically option is selected, students can view assignment grades as soon as they are entered.
Notes: 
Anonymous and moderated assignments cannot be set to post grades automatically.
If you select the Automatically Post Grades option after you have already hidden grades, previously hidden grades will remain hidden.
Post Grades Manually
To post grades manually, select the Manually option. When the Manually option is selected, grades are hidden by default and must be posted to be viewed by students.
Update Policy
To apply changes to the grade posting policy, click the Save button.
View Gradebook
When a manual posting policy has been applied to an assignment, the assignment header displays the Manual label. This label indicates that a manual posting policy is currently in place and future grades are hidden from student view.
Once a submission has been graded, the assignment header displays the Visibility icon. This indicates that there are grades within the assignment that must be posted before they can be viewed by students. 
When grades are hidden from student view, the Total column also displays the Visibility icon. This indicates that the total grade in the Gradebook differs from the total grade viewed by the student. 
To manage the default posting policy for a course, click the Settings icon.
