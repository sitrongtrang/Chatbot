How do I access the Canvas beta environment as an admin
Access Beta Environment
To log in to your beta environment, type [organization name].beta.instructure.com into the URL field. 
View Test Installation Message
Users in the beta environment will see the Test Installation bar across the bottom of the screen indicating the user is in a Canvas Test Installation. Beta environments reset every Saturday and any content created in this environment will be deleted. If you want to save any course content created in your beta environment, you can export your course. 
Note: To hide the Test Installation bar, click the close icon. 
Manage Canvas Features
Some new features may be released as opt-in only and will not appear until you enable them in your beta environment. You can view these features by clicking the Settings link and clicking the Feature Options tab.
