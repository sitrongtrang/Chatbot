Where do I find my institution's URL to access Canvas
Find Your School's Canvas URL
To search for and find your institution or school's Canvas URL, use the Canvas URL search page. Enter your school's name in the search page and be as specific as possible. You can also try alternative names for your school, such as the name of your school district, abbreviations, or longer institution names.
Canvas Web Access
You can access Canvas through an institution-specific Canvas URL. Canvas URLs use one of the following structures: [your institution's name].instructure.com or canvas.[your institution's name].edu. 
Some institution's may also allow access to Canvas via an institution-specific authentication system which redirects to Canvas, such a school student portal or website. 
Canvas Network and Free-For-Teacher Accounts
Canvas Network and Free-For-Teacher accounts do not follow an institution-specific URL structure. 
You can access Canvas Network accounts at learn.canvas.net. 
You can access Free-For-Teacher accounts at canvas.instructure.com.
