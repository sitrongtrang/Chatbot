How do I validate links in a course as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Validation Link
In the sidebar, click the Validate Links in Content link.
Start Link Validation
Click the Start Link Validation button.
View Links
If any links are found in the course, Canvas displays the number of links, followed by the name of the content item and the content's associated invalid link(s).
View Unpublished Content
By default, the Show links to unpublished content checkbox is selected. The page will display any broken links in unpublished content.
View Broken Link Details
The validator displays broken links and images by item type. Broken content is identified as either a link or an image. Non-existent content means that the object is invalid and should be replaced. Unreachable objects mean the image could not be displayed.
Update Links
To update links within course content, click the name of the content item.
After you update your content, you can validate your links again by returning to the Link Validator page and clicking the Restart Link Validation button.
