Assignment rubrics display below the assignment instructions. 
Rubrics include criteria, each with a set of ratings and point values. A rubric criterion may include up to five different ratings.
Note: Depending on how the instructor set up the rubric, it may or may not include point values. If the rubric does not include point values the instructor may still use it to provide feedback on your assignment.

Some rubric criterion may include a longer description. To view the long description, click the view longer description link.
Rubrics may also include learning outcomes used to assess learning mastery. Learning outcomes display an Outcome icon. The outcome also shows the threshold for the outcome, or the number of points a student must achieve in order to meet expectations.
