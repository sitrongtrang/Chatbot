How do I take a quiz where I can only view one question at a time as a student
Next Questions
Each question will appear on the screen by itself. Once you have answered the question, the Next button will turn blue. Click the Next button to advance through the quiz.
Previous Questions
If your instructor allows you to return to prior questions, you can click the Previous button to check your answers or return to questions you left blank.
Navigate Questions in Sidebar
You can also use the sidebar links for quicker navigation between questions. The question mark icon shows the questions you still need to answer while the checkmark icon shows you the questions you have answered. If your instructor allows you to return to prior questions, you may return to a previously answered question by clicking the link to that question.
Lock Questions after Answering
If your instructor does not allow you to go back to questions after you answer them, a pop-up window will display a warning message when you begin your quiz.
Blank Responses
If you leave a question blank and try to advance to the next question, a pop-up window will display a warning message to explain that you won't be able to return to this question.
