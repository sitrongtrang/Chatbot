Using SSE setting with your SQS (Optional)
Canvas Live Events service supports SSE enabled on SQS, in order for SSE to be used the following setup needs to be enabled on the customer SQS :
1. Create a CMK or custom key with this policy, which can be generated by following the steps for creating a CMK, and during step 4 (Define Key Usage Permissions), clicking “Add another AWS Account” and entering the Instructure account number636161780776.

2. Create an SQS queue, and enable SSE. Provide the ARN of the newly-created CMK.
3. Create a new IAM policy, that grants access to the queue and the key, the policy needs to look exactly like this:
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [{
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "kms:GenerateDataKey",
 "kms:Decrypt"
 ],
 "Resource": "CMK arn"
 }, {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "sqs:SendMessage",
 "sqs:SendMessageBatch"
 ],
 "Resource": "queue arn"
 }]???????????????????????????????????????????????????
4. Create a new IAM user and attach the above policy. Save the access key and secret key, and provide them to us as part of the subscription.
