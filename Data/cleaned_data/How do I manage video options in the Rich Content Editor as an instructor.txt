How do I manage video options in the Rich Content Editor as an instructor
Open Rich Content Editor
Open the Rich Content Editor when creating or editing an announcement, assignment, discussion, page, quiz, or syllabus.
Note: The Rich Content Editor supports keyboard shortcuts. To view the Keyboard Shortcuts menu, click the Keyboard icon or press ALT+F8 (PC keyboard) or Option+F8 (Mac keyboard).
Open Video Options
To manage video options for a video previously uploaded in the Rich Content Editor, select the video, then click the Video Options button. 
Note: The Video Options button will not display for videos embedded from other websites.
Manage Video Options
To edit the video title, use the Title field. 
By default, videos created or uploaded using the Rich Content Editor will display as an embedded video. To display as a text link that will open in a new tab when clicked, select the Display Text Link option. 
To manage an embedded video's size, select the Size drop-down. 
Any closed caption or subtitle files that have been added will display in the Closed Captions/Subtitles section. To remove a closed caption or subtitle file, click the Delete icon. To a closed caption or subtitle file, click the Add icon. 
Notes: 
SRT and VTT caption files are supported in the Rich Content Editor.
Users can view video captions in the Canvas apps. However, iOS devices can only display captions in WebVTT format. If you use another format besides WebVTT, users on iOS devices will not be able to display the video captions.
Save Video Options
To save your changes, click the Done button.
