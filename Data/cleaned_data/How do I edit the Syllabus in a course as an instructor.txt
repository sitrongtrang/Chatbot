How do I edit the Syllabus in a course as an instructor
Open Syllabus
In Course Navigation, click the Syllabus link.
Edit Syllabus
Click the Edit button.
Edit Syllabus Description
Edit the syllabus description using the Rich Content Editor.
You can post your course description, a brief introduction, class guidelines, weekly reminders, and other important information in the Syllabus Description. You can copy content from Word documents directly into the Rich Content Editor or create original content inside of the Rich Content Editor. You can also use the Rich Content Editor to embed videos and input HTML.
Add Files
To embed a document in your syllabus, highlight the text where you want to apply the file link and click the Documents Options arrow to select the file document. In the Rich Content Editor, the text will turn blue noting the link is downloadable. 
Note: To remove the document, click and highlight the text in the Rich Content Editor, and then press delete (MAC) or backspace (PC).
Manage Course Summary
The Course Summary is enabled by default. It is automatically generated based on course assignments and course calendar events. Items within the Course Summary can only be changed by editing or deleting the assignments or events. All assignments (unpublished and published) are listed in the syllabus for instructors.
To disable the Course Summary, uncheck the Show Course Summary checkbox.
