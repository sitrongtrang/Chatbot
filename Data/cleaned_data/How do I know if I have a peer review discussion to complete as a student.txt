How do I know if I have a peer review discussion to complete as a student
View Dashboard
Once a peer review is assigned to you, a notification will appear in several dashboard areas.
View Recent Activity
On your Dashboard, you can view recent activity in your Global Activity Stream. Recent activity will display a peer review and the name of the course. Click the Show More link to access the assignment and view the name of the peer review student. 
If a peer review is anonymous, the name will show as Anonymous User.
View To Do List
On both the Dashboard and the Course Home Page sidebar, the To Do list shows the peer review discussion. Peer reviews are identified with the Peer Review icon. To review the discussion, click the Peer Review for [Discussion Name] link. 
Note: Currently the Due Date in the To Do List does not accurately display the due date for completing your peer review. If details about your peer review are not already included in the details of your graded discussion, please contact your instructor.

Note: You can also access your Assignments through your Dashboard, Course Activity Stream, Assignments, the Syllabus, Gradebook, Calendar, or Modules.
