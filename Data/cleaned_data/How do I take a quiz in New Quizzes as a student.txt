View Unavailable Quiz
When your enrollment has been concluded in a course, a message displays that the quiz is no longer available. 
View Quiz with Availability Dates
When a quiz is open to you during availability dates, you can view all available quiz information in addition to the specific dates the quiz is available to you. Availability dates may include a first available date (open date), last available date (locked or closed), or both dates to create an overall date range. The Due date may be before or on the last available date (if one is set).
In the example above, the quiz is available to you starting October 15 at 11 pm and is due by October 17th at 11:59 pm. However, if you were to miss the due date, you could still take the quiz until October 20th at 10:59 pm for late credit. If you do not submit the quiz by the last available date of October 20 at 10:59 pm (as indicated in your local time zone), Canvas will automatically submit the quiz on the last available date. On October 20 at 11 pm, the quiz will not be available to you.
