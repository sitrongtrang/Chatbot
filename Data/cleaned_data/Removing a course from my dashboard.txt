Removing a course from my dashboard
Open Courses List
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link. Then click the All Courses link. 
View Past Enrollments
You may be able to view a list of your past enrollments in your Courses List. If a course in the Past Enrollments list is favorited, you can click the Favorite icon to unfavorite the course. 
If you have a course that has ended but is still on the dashboard, it is likely that it is missing an end date in the course settings. As a student, you cannot change this.
If youâ€™d like to remove it, your instructor will need to add an end date. Contact your instructor for assistance using the Inbox or through the help menu.
Alternatively, you can use course favoriting to determine which courses appear on your dashboard.
Note: Courses in the Past Enrollments list cannot be favorited.
