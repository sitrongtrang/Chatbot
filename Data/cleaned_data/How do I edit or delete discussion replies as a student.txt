If you delete a discussion reply with other course user replies attached, Canvas shows a Deleted by notification. The notification includes your name and the date and time the post was deleted. This entry cannot be removed. 
However, if you delete a reply that does not have any course user replies attached, Canvas does display a Deleted by notification. 
Note: Course instructors can see that you deleted your replies in the discussion.
View Restricted Options
If your instructor has restricted the option to edit or delete your discussion replies, the options are disabled.
Note: If the ability for students to edit or delete their own posts is restricted in a course with Discussions Redesign enabled, the Edit and Delete options do not display in the Options menu.
