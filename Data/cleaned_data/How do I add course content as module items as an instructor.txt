How do I add course content as module items as an instructor
Open Modules
In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
Add Module Item
To add an item, click the Add Item icon, or drag and drop to add files to an empty module.
Add Item to Module
Click the Add drop-down menu and select one of the following item types:
Assignment
Quiz
File (document and media file types)
Page
Discussion
Notes: 
Canvas will accept most media files as uploads. However, not all media files can be played within Canvas.
When adding content using the add drop-down menu it loads the first 200 assignments, 400 quizzes, 200 discussions, and 100 external tools.
Add New Item
If you want to add a new item, click the [New] link and type a name in the name field.
Depending on the item type, when adding new content you may be asked to complete additional fields.
Upload File
If you are adding a file to a module, you can upload a new file by clicking the Create File(s) link. Uploaded files are automatically published and also display in Course Files.
To select a file from your computer, click the Choose File(s) button. If enabled by your institution, you may be able to select multiple files.
To select a destination folder for your uploaded file, select an option in the Folder drop-down menu.
If an uploaded file is a duplicate of an existing file, Canvas displays a prompt asking if the file should be overwritten, renamed, or skipped.
Add Existing Item
If you have already created the item you want to add, click the name of the item. To select more than one item press Shift and select the first and last item in the list you would like to add.
Indent Item
Choose the Indentation drop-down menu to indent the item inside of the module.
