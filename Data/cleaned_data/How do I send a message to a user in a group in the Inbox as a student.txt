How do I send a message to a user in a group in the Inbox as a student
Open Inbox
In Global Navigation, click the Inbox link.
Compose Message
Click the Compose icon.
Select Course
Click the Course drop-down menu, then select the course name. 
Add Users
To add a user, you can search for the user in the To field or use the Address Book. 
Search for Users
To search for a user, type the user's name in the To field. Canvas automatically populates matching names. Select the user's name. 
To send a message to multiple users, type the names of additional users in the To field.
View Student Groups
To view and add a user in a student group, click the Address Book button, then the Student Groups option. Select the group name. 
Add Group Member
Group members' names display in alphabetical order by last name. Select the user's name which you would like to add to the message. 
To send a message to multiple users, navigate back to the group member list by clicking the Address Book button.
Send Message
In the Subject field, enter a subject line for your message.
If you are sending your message to multiple users, but you do not want each user to see who else was included in the message, click the Send an individual message to each recipient checkbox. If your message includes over 100 recipients (including you as the sender), this checkbox is selected by default.
In the message field, type your message. All content is sent in plain text. URLs included in a message automatically become clickable links after the message is sent.
If you want to include an attachment or media file, click the Attachment or Media File buttons.
When you are finished, click the Send button.
