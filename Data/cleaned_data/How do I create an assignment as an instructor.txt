How do I create an assignment as an instructor
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Add Assignment Shell
If you want to create an assignment placeholder with a title and a date, you can create an assignment shell in an assignment group. 
Assignment groups house the different types of assignments you may want to keep in your course, such as assignments, discussions, quizzes, surveys, etc. If you create assignment groups in your course, students can filter their assignments page by assignment type to view the same groups. Learn how to add an assignment group.
To create an assignment shell, locate an assignment group and click the Add Assignment button. Assignment shells only include fields for the assignment type, name, due date (optional), and points. You can add assignment details at any time by editing the assignment. 
Add Assignment
If you want to create an assignment with all assignment details at the same time, click the Add Assignment button. 
Assignment details include fields for the assignment type, name, description, points, assignment group (if desired), grade display, and submission type, and due dates. You can also specify if the assignment is a group assignment or requires peer reviews in the assignment details lesson. 
When you add details to an assignment, you can also assign the assignment to all students, course sections, course groups, or individual students as part of the Canvas differentiated assignments feature.
