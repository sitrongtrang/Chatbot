How do I view course activity for an account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Admin Tools
In Account Navigation, click the Admin Tools link.
Open Logging
Click the Logging tab. 
Select Log Type
From the log type drop-down menu, select the Course Activity option.
Search by Course Name or Course ID
Search by Course ID or course name. You can locate your course ID number at the end of your course URL (i.e. canvas.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXX).
Once you start to type the course information, Canvas will generate a drop-down list of matching Canvas courses. Results are based on valid field entries, so if no results appear (especially if searching by name), confirm the information and try again.
You can also enter a date range in the date fields. Dates are not required, but adding dates will narrow your results.
Find Course Activity
Click the Find button.
View Course Activity
Canvas will display any applicable results for the field(s) you selected:
The Date of the activity
The Time of the activity
The User who performed the activity
The Type of activity (concluded, unconcluded, published, deleted, restored, updated, created, copied to, copied from, reset to, and reset from)
The Source of the activity (manual or via API)
The Event Details of the activity type (click View Details link)
