How do I configure an external app for a course using XML as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Apps
Click the Apps tab.
View App Configurations
To configure an app, click the View App Configurations button.
Add New App
Click the Add App button.
Set Configuration Type
Select the Configuration Type drop-down menu and set the configuration type to Paste XML.
Add App Details
Enter the name of the app in the Name field. Enter the consumer key in the Consumer Key field and the shared secret in the Shared Secret field. This key and shared secret will be provided by the vendor or (if using the Edu App Center) provided by the website. 
Note: There are some apps that do not require a consumer key or shared secret, so pay attention to the configuration directions.
Enter Configuration XML
Copy the XML code in the paste XML here field. Click the Submit button to link the app.
Verify App
If the app has already been added in the account, Canvas verifies that you still want to install the app. To continue, click the Yes, Install Tool button.
View App
View the linked app. To manage the app, click the Settings icon. 
To edit the app, click the Edit link. To manage where the app displays in Canvas, click the Placements link. To delete the app, click the Delete link.
Note: When you click the Placements link, you may see a No Placements Enabled message. This message indicates that the app does not have any specified placements within Canvas. However, the app will still work as intended.
