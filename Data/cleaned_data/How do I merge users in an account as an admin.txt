How do I merge users in an account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open People
In Account Navigation, click the People link.
Find User
Use the filter and search options to find the user in the account.
Open User Profile
In the search results, click the user's name.
Merge User
Click the Merge with Another User link.
Find User Account
Locate the user account where you want to merge the user's information. You can either search for the user or enter the user's ID. 
If you are enrolled in multiple accounts, the User Accounts page displays an account menu. In the drop-down menu, select the account where the user is located.
To locate a user by name, type the user's name in the Name field. Select the user when the full name appears. After confirming the user, click the Select button.
To select a user by user ID, enter the ID in the User ID field and click the Go button. 
Note: The User ID is found at the end of your Canvas URL (i.e. account.instructure.com/account/XXXXXX/users/XXXXXX).
Merge User Accounts
After selecting the user account to merge, you will see the process and end result table.
The table will show you the User, Action, Emails, Logins, and Enrollments of each user. The table will tell you what will be deleted and kept.
If you want to change positions of the users so one gets deleted and the other does not, click the Switch User Positions button.
You can also click the Merge Someone Else With [User Name] for either of the users if you decide to change the users.
When you are ready, click the Prepare to Merge Users button.
Note: The table will not display enrollments in concluded courses or courses in an unpublished state.
Confirm Merge
You will be prompted one more time to ask if you are sure about merging the users together. When you are ready, click the Merge User Accounts button.
Note: This process cannot be undone.
View Confirmation
Confirm the merge was successful.
