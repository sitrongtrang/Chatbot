How do I configure self registration through Canvas authentication for an account as an admin
Open Account
Click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Authentication
In Account Navigation, click the Authentication link.
Configure Self Registration
By default, Self Registration is disabled. To enable Self Registration, select the radio button for the registration type for your account. 
To allow self registration for all users, select the All Account Types option. To limit self registration to observers (including parents), select the Observer Accounts Only option.
To require users to complete a Captcha form before completing the registation process, click the Require Captcha for Self Registration checkbox.
Canvas enforces MFA is functionally equivalent to the legacy UIs checkbox for MFA Required being enabled. 
To have Canvas enforce the MFA, select the Canvas enforces MFA option. 
To have the user opt in, select User can opt in to MFA option.
Note: If the All Account Types option is selected, it is recommended to require users to complete a Captcha form to avoid the creation of spam users.
Save Self Registration
Click the Save button.
