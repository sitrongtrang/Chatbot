View All Courses
You can view all courses that have been included in the public course index, with the most recently created courses shown first.
You can view the name of the course and a description, if any.
Search Courses
You can search for courses in several different ways. In the Name field, you can type the name of a course. 
You can also search for courses by status. If you want to view only public courses, click the Public courses only checkbox. If you want to view only open enrollment courses, click the Open enrollment courses only checkbox. Open enrollment courses are courses that you can join at any time.
