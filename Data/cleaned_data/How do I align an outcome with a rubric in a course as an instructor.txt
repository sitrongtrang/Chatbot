How do I align an outcome with a rubric in a course as an instructor
Open Rubrics
In Course Navigation, click the Rubrics link.
Open Rubric
Click the name of a rubric.
Create Rubric
To create a new rubric, click the Add Rubric button.
Edit Rubric
Click the Edit Rubric button.
Find Outcome
Click the Find Outcome link.
Import Outcome
Locate and select the outcome you want to align. 
If you want to use the criterion for scoring, click the Use this criterion for scoring checkbox. Selecting this checkbox displays the point value of the criterion directly in the rubric and contributes to the overall rubric point value. However, if this checkbox is not selected, the point value will not be factored into the rubric. The criterion point value will not be displayed after the rubric is updated.
