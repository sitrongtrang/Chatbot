How do I archive a grading scheme in a course as an instructor
Open Settings

Open Course Details
Click the Course Details tab.
Enable Grading Scheme
If the checkbox has not been selected, click the Enable course grading scheme checkbox.
Manage All Grading Schemes
To manage the grading schemes, click the Manage All Grading Schemes link.

Notes:
Archived grading schemes can still be used wherever they are currently in use, but they cannot be selected for new courses or assignments.
An archived grading scheme cannot be leveraged in the future by a course or assignment unless the scheme is restored.
You cannot archive the Default Canvas Grading Scheme.
When copying or exporting a course, archived default grading schemes are not copied or exported.
