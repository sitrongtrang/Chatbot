How do I use Chat as a student
Open Chat
In Course Navigation, click the Chat link.
View Chat
When you open the Chat page, you immediately join the chat. Chat discussion appears in the content window. 
To receive alerts for new chat messages, click the New message alerts button. If this option is turned on, you will receive alerts if Chat is open in Canvas but your browser window is minimized or you are viewing another browser tab. Alerts will not send if you leave Chat to view another area in Canvas.
Message history each course is included in the chat. Chat history can be accessed indefinitely by loading more results and scrolling through previous course chats.
