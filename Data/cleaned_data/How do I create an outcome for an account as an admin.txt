How do I create an outcome for an account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Outcomes
In Account Navigation, click the Outcomes link.
Add Outcome
Click the New Outcome button.
Create Outcome
Enter a name for the outcome in the Name this outcome field. 
When instructors allow students to view Learning Mastery scores on the Grades page, students will see the name of the outcome. However, you may want to create a custom, friendly name. To create a friendly name for student view, enter a name in the Friendly name (optional) field. 
You can also enter a description in the Rich Content Editor field.
Add Criterion Ratings
Click the Edit icon to edit the criterion rating. You can change the existing name (if desired) for the criterion in the Criterion Name field. Set the criterion point value by typing in the Points field. 
To save the criterion, click the OK button. To remove the criterion completely, click the Delete button.
To add additional criterion ratings, click the Insert link.
Note: If you cannot edit criteria for your outcome, your institution has enabled account-wide mastery scales.
Set Mastery and Calculation Method
Set the mastery point value in the Mastery at field. This field indicates the number of points that must be achieved for mastery according to the criterion ratings.
In the Calculation Method drop-down menu, select the calculation method for the outcome. By default, new outcomes are set to the Weighted Average calculation method in the Canvas interface.
Click the Save button.
Note: If you cannot edit calculation methods for your outcome, your institution has enabled account-wide outcome calculation methods.
