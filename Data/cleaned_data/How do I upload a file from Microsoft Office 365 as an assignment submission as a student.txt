How do I upload a file from Microsoft Office 365 as an assignment submission as a student
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Select Assignment
Click the title of the assignment.
Start Assignment
Click the Start Assignment button.
Open Office 365
Click the Office 365 tab. 
Note: If the Office 365 tab is not available, your institution has not enabled this feature.
Attach File
Microsoft Office 365 will display a list of all allowed file types. Click the name of the file, then click the Attach File button. 
Note: When the Allow Multiple file AGS submissions count as one submission is enabled, you can select multiple files to be uploaded to a third-party assignment in Canvas. However, some third-party tools may not be built to accommodate this feature.
Submit Assignment
In the File field, confirm your selected file. To select a new file, click the Change button.
Click the Submit Assignment button.
View Submission Notification
After you submit your assignment, Canvas displays a message notifying you that your submission is processing. You can navigate away from the assignment submission page without disrupting the file upload. You will also receive an email notification when your submission completes processing.
To clear the notification, click the OK button. 
View Submission
View the confirmation of your assignment submission. 
View Uploading and Failed Submission Icons
If your submission has been queued for upload, an uploading icon displays. This icon also displays for your instructor if they access the assignment before it uploads. 
If your submission failed to upload, an upload failed icon displays. Click the download submission link to view the error.
