How do I select a grade posting policy for a course in the Gradebook as an instructor
Open Grades
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
Open Gradebook Settings
Click the Settings icon.
View Grade Posting Policy
Click the Grade Posting Policy tab.
Post Grades Automatically
To post grades automatically, select the Automatically Post Grades option. When grades are posted automatically, students can view assignment grades as soon as they are entered.
Note: If you select the Automatically Post Grades option after you have already hidden grades, previously hidden grades will remain hidden.
Post Grades Manually
To manually post grades for students to view, select the Manually Post Grades option. When the Manually Post Grades option is selected, grades are hidden from student view by default and must be posted to be viewed by students.
Update Policy
To apply changes to the grade posting policy, click the Apply Settings button.
View Gradebook
If a manual posting policy has been applied in a course, all assignment headers will display the Manual label. This label indicates that a manual posting policy is currently in place and future grades are hidden from student view.
Once a submission has been graded, the assignment header displays the Visibility icon. This indicates that there are grades within the assignment that must be posted before they can be viewed by students.
When grades are hidden from student view, the Total column also displays the Visibility icon. This indicates that the total grade in the Gradebook differs from the total grade viewed by the student.
To manage the posting policy for an assignment, click the Options icon.
