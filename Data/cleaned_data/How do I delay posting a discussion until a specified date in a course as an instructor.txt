How do I delay posting a discussion until a specified date in a course as an instructor
Open Discussions
In Course Navigation, click the Discussions link.
Add Discussion
Click the Add Discussion button.
Create Discussion
Enter a title for your discussion in the Topic Title field.
To add discussion content, use the Rich Content Editor. 
You can also select discussion options. 
Add Availability Dates
To make your discussion available on a specific date or during a specific date range, enter the dates in the Available From and Until fields, or click the calendar icons to select dates. 
You are not required to enter dates in both of these fields, so if you want to delay your posting but do want your post to appear indefinitely, you can leave the Until field blank.
Note: These fields only apply for non-graded discussions; If you create a graded discussion, these date fields do not apply. 
Save and Publish
If you are ready to publish your discussion, click the Save & Publish button. If you want to create a draft of your discussion and publish it later, click the Save button.
When your discussion is saved in a draft state, you can return to the page and publish it at any time by clicking the Publish button in the classic Discussions interface or the Publish icon in the Discussions Redesign interface. 
View Discussion
View the discussion and the posting date.
Students do not have access to locked discussions until the availability date. They will not see locked discussions on the Discussions Index Page.
