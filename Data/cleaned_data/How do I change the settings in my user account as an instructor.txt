Change Settings
If enabled, edit the appropriate settings:
Full Name is used for the Gradebook and Grades pages, Chat, People, and SIS imports.
Display Name is how other users will see your name in Announcements, Conferences, Conversations, and Discussions.
Sortable Name defaults to your last name, first name and appears in sorted lists so admins can search for it.
Pronouns display after your name in various areas throughout Canvas.
Default Email can be set when you have multiple Notification email addresses associated with your account.
Language can be set to your native language and is the language you want to use in Canvas (does not apply if an instructor sets a specific language for a course).
Time Zone can be set to where you are located and displays assignments in your local time.
Password is the combination of characters you choose to use to log in to your Canvas account.
Note: Some settings may not be available to you. If you are not able to edit your user settings, you will need to contact your institution to change this information.
