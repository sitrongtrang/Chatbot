Open Admins
Click the Admins tab.
Add Account Admins 
Click the Add Account Admins button. 
Add Admin Role and Email
In the Add More drop-down menu, set the admin role type. The default admin role in Canvas is Account Admin which has access to all account-level permissions. You can also create admin roles for your institution and manage their permissions.  
In the text box, type the email address of the user. 
Click the Continue... button.
Note: Once you add a user as an account admin, they will have all permissions listed on the Permissions page for the selected role. Additionally, you cannot edit an admin account after you create it. If you need to change an admin user's role, you must delete their admin account and add it again.
