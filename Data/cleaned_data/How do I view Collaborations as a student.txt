How do I view Collaborations as a student
Open Collaborations
In Course Navigation, click the Collaborations link.
View Collaborations
The Collaborations page displays all collaborations where you have been invited to participate. For each collaboration, you can view the name of the collaboration, the description, the person who created the collaboration, and the date and time the collaboration was created.
Add Collaboration
If you have permission, your institution may allow you to create collaborations in your course.
To create a new collaboration, click the Start a new collaboration button.

If your collaborations page does not match the image shown in this lesson, you can still create a Google Docs collaboration.
