How do I view captions in a video in the Rich Content Editor as an instructor

Embedded videos display directly in Canvas.
Note: Videos that are embedded as extra large size or larger with captions display a Captions icon.
Select Caption Language
To view the video captions, click the Settings icon then select the Captions link. To view captions in an offered language, click the language name. 
View Captions
When closed captioning is enabled, you can view the captions as the video plays.
