How do I view all groups in a course as a student
Open People
In Course Navigation, click the People link.
Note: If your instructor has disabled the People link in Course Navigation, you can only view groups you are enrolled in.
Open Groups
Click the Groups tab.
Or, to open your groups from the Options menu, click the Options icon and then click the View User Groups link.
View Course Groups
View the groups available in your course. Each group shows the name of the group and how many members are part of that group. 
If there are any self sign-up groups available to join, you can join the group by clicking the Join button, or you can switch groups within a group set by clicking the Switch To button. 
If you are already part of a self sign-up group, you can leave the group by clicking the Leave button.
Note: You cannot leave groups that are not self sign-up groups.
View Student Leader Groups
If you have been invited to be a student leader and manage a group, the Manage link displays. 
View Visit Group
If you are a current group member, the Visit link displays. To access the group's Home page and the Group Navigation menu, visit the group.
View Group Members
To view which students are assigned to the group, click anywhere in the group. The names of the students display in an expanded list. 
The Person icon displays next to the student group leader.
