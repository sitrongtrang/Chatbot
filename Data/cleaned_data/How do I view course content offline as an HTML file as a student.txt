How do I view course content offline as an HTML file as a student
Open Modules
In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
Export Course Content
Click the Export Course Content button.
Export Course
The course will download to your computer as a ZIP file. If you remain in the page until the download is complete, the file will download directly to your computer.
If you leave the page, you'll receive an email notification when the course download is complete. You can use a link in the email to download the file.
View Export History
When the export is complete, the Exported Package History page shows the most recent export. To download the export again, click the date of the export.
If you export the course again at a later date, the most recent export will always display in the page, along with previous exports.
Open ZIP File
Once the file has been downloaded, locate the ZIP file on your computer. Double click the file to open it (MAC users) or right-click the file and select Extract All (PC users). 
When the file expands, open the course folder and open the index.html file.
Open Course Content
The HTML file will open in your default browser. Offline downloads include all content from the course at the time of the download. You will need to download the course each time you want to view updated course content.
If any content can only be accessed online, the content link includes an external icon identifying the content as online only.
