How do I view a user's profile in a course as an instructor
Open People
In Course Navigation, click the People link.
Locate User
In the search field, search for the name of the user. You can also filter users by role in the Roles drop-down menu.
Open User Details
Click the user's Options icon, then select the User Details link.
View Name and Bio
In the user's profile, you can view the user's name and profile picture (if enabled by your institution). If the user allows, you may also be able to view contact information and a biography.
Report Profile Picture
If the user has an inappropriate profile picture, you can report the image to your Canvas admin by hovering over the picture and clicking the Flag icon.

In the Enrollments section, you can view all the active course and group enrollments for the student in any courses and groups where you are the instructor.
View Links
In the Links section, you can add any links added to the user's profile.
View Memberships
The Memberships section shows the user's course enrollment and user role, as well as any course privileges.
Note: If the user was assigned a custom role, currently only the base role is displayed.
