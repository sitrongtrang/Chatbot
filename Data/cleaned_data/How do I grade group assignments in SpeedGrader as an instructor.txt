How do I grade group assignments in SpeedGrader as an instructor
Open SpeedGrader
Open SpeedGrader from the group assignment.
View Group Submissions
When evaluating group assignments, the SpeedGrader drop-down menu displays the name of each group. Select the name of the group whose submission you want to view.
Grade Submission
To submit a grade for all members of the group, enter the grade in the Grade field. 
If a Rubric is attached to the assignment, you can view the rubric by clicking the View Rubric button. If your rubric is set up for grading, the Grade field will automatically populate with the rubric grade results. 
Send Group Feedback
You can leave feedback comments using the Assignment Comments section. Comments made on group assignments that are not graded individually are sent to the whole group. Assignment comments display as a new thread in Conversations. 
View Group Submission with Individual Grading
If the group assignment was set up to assign grades to each student individually, the submission will still apply for each group member's assignment, but the drop-down menu displays the name of each individual student.
When grading the submission, the entered grade will only apply for the student whose submission you are viewing. 
Individually graded group assignments include commenting options. To send your comment to one student in a group, select Send comment to this student only. To send your comment to the whole group, select Send comment to the whole group.
Individual comments also appear in the Submission Comments filter in Conversations.
