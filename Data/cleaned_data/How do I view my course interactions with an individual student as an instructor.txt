The Student Interactions Report will show you information for the student in all enrolled courses. You can view the last time you interacted with the student, the current grade for the student, the final grade for the student, and if there are any submitted but ungraded assignments for the student. You can also quickly access the Conversations page to send a message to the student by clicking the message icon.
