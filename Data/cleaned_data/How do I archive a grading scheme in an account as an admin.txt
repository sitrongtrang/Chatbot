Open Grading
In Account Navigation, click the Grading link.

Click the Grading Schemes tab.

Cicking the Archive icon.

Notes:
A grading scheme in use can be archived and then unarchived and restored to an active state.
Archived grading schemes can still be used wherever they are currently in use, but they cannot be selected for new courses or assignments.
You cannot archive the Default Canvas Grading Scheme.
When copying or exporting a course, archived default grading schemes are not copied or exported.
