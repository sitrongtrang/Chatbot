How do I get authorized to connect Canvas Data 2 via an API Client (Postman) as an admin
Generate Client Credentials via Identity Services
Before using a Postman, you need to generate a Client ID and Secret for Canvas Data 2.
Add New Authorization Request
In Postman, to add a new request, click the Add tab and then click the Authorization tab.
Select Authorization Type
In the Authentication Type drop-down menu, select the Basic Auth option.
Note: You can also use a CURL script to retrieve a token.
Enter User Credentials
Enter the user credentials:
Username (Client ID): enter the developer key generated in Identity Services
Password (Client Secret): enter the secret generated in Identity Services
Select POST method as the request type, and set the following URL:
https://api-gateway.instructure.com/ids/auth/login
Generate Access Token
In the Body tab, select the x-www-form-urlencoded option. In the KEY field, enter “grant_type” and in the VALUE field, enter “client_credentials”.
Click the Send button. 
In case of successful authorization, you will receive the access token in the API response. You can use this short-lived token to send request to the CD2 API.
For all available requests, check the Canvas Data 2 API Documentation.
You can also use the preconfigured requests from the Postman collection described in the set up Canvas Data 2 in Postman document.
