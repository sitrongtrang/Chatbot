How do I customize my Courses list as an observer
Open Courses
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link, then click the All Courses link.
Manage Courses
To favorite a course, click the star next to a course. Courses with filled stars show the course is a favorite. 
Notes: 
After you have manually favorited at least one course, Canvas automatically favorites any new published course enrollments for you.
You can only favorite active courses.
View Unpublished Courses
If a course is unpublished and you are allowed to view unpublished courses before the course start date, you cannot favorite the course. If you hover over a star icon for an unpublished course, you can view a message indicating that the course cannot be added as a favorite.
Future and past enrollments also cannot be favorited.
View Past Enrollments
Depending on course configuration, you may still be able to view concluded courses under the Past Enrollments heading. However, a favorited course is not automatically removed as a favorite when the course concludes. If a past enrollment course still shows as a favorite, you can unfavorite the course by clicking the star icon.
