How do I manage profile pictures for users in an account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open People
In Account Settings, click the People link.
Manage Profile Pictures
Click the Manage Profile Pictures link. 
View Profile Pictures
You can view and filter profile pictures by the following categories:
Submitted: pictures that users have submitted but they haven't been approved or deleted
Reported: pictures that have been reported
Approved, Re-Reported: pictures that have been approved and re-reported
All: all the pictures within the account
Manage Profile Picture
Within each category, you can manage individual profile pictures with links to approve, lock, or delete the picture. Locking the profile picture means the image is approved but the user cannot change the profile picture. Locked profile pictures can be unlocked at any time.
Each status (except submitted) includes an associated icon:
approved profile pictures display a check mark
locked profile pictures display a lock icon
reported profile pictures display a warning icon
