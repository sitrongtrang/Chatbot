What are External Apps (LTI Tools)
When would I use an External App?
External Apps add functionality to a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may want to include a study aid (flashcards, mini-quizzes, etc.) to help students better understand the concepts being taught. 
Admins can add external apps for accounts and subaccounts via XML, URL, or manual configuration.
If apps do not already exist for a course, instructors can add external apps in their courses to create additional learning paths for students. External apps can be added to Modules, Course Navigation, the Rich Content Editor, and Assignments.
In the Rich Content Editor, external apps can be accessed from the Apps icon or added to the toolbar for an account.
When would I use the Canvas App Center?
Admins and instructors can also enable apps through the App Center, which is integrated directly in Canvas.
The Canvas App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. It allows you to:
Add new features to Canvas at the account or course level
Configure apps to link to modules or assessments
Install apps without the help of IT
Created a customized teaching experience
Open the door to more possibilities 
Filter apps by name
View installed apps
The App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. 
Admins can manage the apps that can be used in courses for accounts and subaccounts by creating an allow list in the Edu App Center and managing the allow list in Canvas.
