How do I view a group calendar as a student
Open Groups
In Global Navigation, click the Groups link, then click the name of the group.
View Calendar
In the Group sidebar, click the View Calendar link.
Only your group calendar will be visible in the list of Canvas calendars. Feel free to add any events or reminders to your group calendar.
