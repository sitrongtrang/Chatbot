How do I use the Dashboard as an instructor
Open Dashboard
In Global Navigation, click the Dashboard link.
View Dashboard
The Dashboard is your landing page in Canvas. Depending on your institution, your Dashboard may default to one of two views: Card View or Recent Activity View.
Card View: displays course cards for quick access to all your favorite courses (the same courses display in the Courses link from the Global Navigation Menu)
Recent Activity View: displays all recent activity for all courses
View To Do List & Sidebar
In the Card View Dashboard and the Recent Activity Dashboard, the sidebar contains a To Do list and other sections that help you know what assignments and events are coming up in all of your courses. Learn more about the dashboard sidebar. 
View Global Announcement
The Dashboard may also include global announcements, which are announcements created by your institution. To remove the announcement from your dashboard, click the Remove icon.
View Dismissed Announcement
If you dismiss a global announcement, you can view dismissed announcements on the Global Announcements page.
Change Dashboard View
To change your Dashboard view, click the Options menu. You can view the Dashboard in Card View or Recent Activity View. If Canvas for Elementary has been enabled in your institution, you can also view the Dashboard in Homeroom View.
