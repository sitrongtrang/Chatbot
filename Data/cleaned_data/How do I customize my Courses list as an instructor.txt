How do I customize my Courses list as an instructor
Open Courses
In Global Navigation, click the Courses link, then click the All Courses link.
Manage Courses
To favorite a course, click the star next to a course. Courses with filled stars show the course is a favorite.
In the Dashboard, any courses you have with an instructor role will be listed first, followed by TA roles and any other custom instructor-based roles. Your courses with student roles are listed last.
Note: When you favorite at least one course, the Dashboard will only display favorited courses. Canvas will also continue to automatically favorite new course enrollments.
View Unpublished Courses
Unpublished courses can be identified by a gray background and the Published column. You can favorite unpublished courses.
View Past Enrollments
Depending on course configuration, you may still be able to view concluded courses under the Past Enrollments heading. However, favorite courses are not automatically removed as favorites when courses conclude. If a past enrollment course still shows as a favorite, you can unfavorite the course by clicking the star icon.
