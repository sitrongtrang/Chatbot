How can I use Canvas on my mobile device as an observer
Mobile Browsers
You can access Canvas from any browser on your Android/iOS device. However, mobile browsers are not supported, and features may not function as expected compared to viewing Canvas in a fully supported desktop browser. 
On mobile devices, Canvas is designed to be used within Canvas mobile applications. Canvas pages within a mobile browser are only supported when an action in the app links directly to the browser, such as when a student takes certain types of quizzes. Support is not extended to pages that cannot currently be used in the app, such as Conferences or Collaborations.
Mobile Applications
We are actively improving our native mobile applications to support as many Canvas features as possible. Instructure has one native mobile application for observers free for download on both phones and tablets.
Canvas Parent: This app is designed for you to engage in your students' education and view assignments, events, and grades. Access to Canvas Parent is managed by your student's institution.View Canvas Parent mobile features by version and device.
You can learn more about mobile applications in the Canvas Mobile Guides.
