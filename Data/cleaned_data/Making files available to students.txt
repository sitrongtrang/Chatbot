Making files available to students
Review File Status and Publish Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Files link. View the files in your course, and locate any files your students cannot access. A circle with a checkmark indicates that the file is Published. A circle-backslash icon indicates that the file is Unpublished. Students can only view published files. 
Note: You may also need to open file folders to confirm that files in folders are also published.
Review Link Validator
If your course includes content imported from previous courses, any links to files may not update correctly to your current course. Use the Link Validator tool to locate broken or missing links. You can then update the links to the current course.
To use the link validator, click the Settings link in Course Navigation.Then click the Validate Links in Content button.
Note: You may also need to open the link and check the URL course code to confirm the file is not going to a previous course.
