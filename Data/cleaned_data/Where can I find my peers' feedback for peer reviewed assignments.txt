Where can I find my peers' feedback for peer reviewed assignments
View Recent Feedback
Under Recent Feedback in the sidebar of your Canvas course, you can view recent comments from peer reviewed assignments. Click the title of the assignment to view all submission details and comments. 
View Submission Details Page
You can view the comment directly in the submission details page.
If your assignment is compatible with the Canvas annotations tool, Canvas DocViewer, your peers may also have left feedback directly in the assignment. To view their comments, click the View Feedback link. This is the same link where you may be able to view feedback from your instructor.
Notes:
When assignment grades are hidden, you can view peer review comments. However, instructor comments are hidden until after assignment are posted.
When peer reviews are anonymous, you can leave submission and rubric comments, but annotated submission comments are not supported.
For group assignments, you will see peer review comments for all reviews of your group's submission.
View Rubric
If your assignment includes a rubric, you can view peer review rubric assessments.
To view the rubric assessment, click the Show Rubric link.
View the peer review rubric assessment, including ratings and comments.
If your assignment was reviewed by multiple people, click the Show Assessment By drop-down menu to select other rubric assessments.
View Assignment Page
You can also view your peers' feedback on the individual assignment page. All comments from your peers will appear in the Submission box.
Note: Peer review feedback only displays on the assignment page for assignments that require an online submission.
View Grades
The comment can also be viewed on your Grades page.
