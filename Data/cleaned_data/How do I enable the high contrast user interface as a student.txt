How do I enable the high contrast user interface as a student
Open User Navigation Menu
In User Navigation, click the Account link.
Enable High Contrast UI
Click the Use High Contrast UI toggle.
Reload Page
For the high contrast UI to take affect, reload the page or navigate to another page in Canvas.
View High Contrast UI
View the high contrast user interface (UI).
The high contrast user interface (UI) enhances the color contrast of text, buttons, and other elements so they are more distinct and easier to identify in Canvas. 
Note: The High Contrast UI setting does not support Institutional branding.
