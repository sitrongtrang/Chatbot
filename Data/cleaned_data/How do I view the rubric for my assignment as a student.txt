Assignment rubrics are shown below the assignment instructions. 
The rubric includes Criteria, Ratings, and full point values. A rubric criterion may include up to five different ratings and individual point values. 
Note: Depending on how your instructor set up the rubric, it may or may not include point values. If the rubric does not include point values your instructor may still use it to provide feedback on your assignment.
Criterion may include a description.
The rubric may also include an outcome associated with the course. Outcomes are identified by a small flag and are used to assess learning mastery in a course. The outcome also shows the threshold for the outcome, or the number of points you must achieve to meet expectations. Your instructor may allow you to view outcomes results in your course grades.
