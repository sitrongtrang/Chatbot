How do I like a reply in a course announcement as a student
Open Announcements
In Course Navigation, click the Announcements link.
Open Announcement
Click the name of the announcement.
Like Announcement Reply
Locate the reply and click the Like icon.
View Liked Reply
The Like icon will be highlighted, indicating you have liked the reply. 
When a reply is liked, the Like icon will also display the total number of likes for all users in the announcement.
View Liking Restriction
If your instructor has restricted the liking option to only users with grading permissions, you will not be able to see the Like icon or like your favorite replies. However, you can still see the total number of likes given to each reply.
