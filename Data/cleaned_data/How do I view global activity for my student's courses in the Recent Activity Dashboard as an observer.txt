How do I view global activity for my student's courses in the Recent Activity Dashboard as an observer
Open Dashboard
In Global Navigation, click the Dashboard link.
View Student Dashboards
To filter your dashboard by student, click the Student drop-down menu, then click the student's name. The dashboard view displays based on your student's dashboard view.
Open Recent Activity Stream
Click the Options icon and then click the Recent Activity link. 
View Recent Activity
The Recent Activity Stream contains recent notifications from all of your courses, including announcements, discussions, assignments, and conversations. Unlike course cards, the activity stream does not mimic the visibility of Course Navigation links. 
Activities are indicated by an activity type icon. Each activity also includes the name of its associated course. 
New activity in a course is indicated by an unread icon. Discussions and Announcements indicate new activity items published in a course, and Conversations indicate a new message received from a user in a course. Recent Activity items remain for four weeks.
Expand and Collapse Notifications
You can view the details of each activity by hovering in the notification area and clicking the Show More link. To collapse recent activity, click the Show Less link.
Manage Recent Activity
You can directly access your recent activities by clicking the course link. To remove a notification, click the Remove icon.
