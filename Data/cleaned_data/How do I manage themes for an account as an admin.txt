How do I manage themes for an account as an admin
Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Themes
In Account Navigation, click the Themes link. 
Note: If sub-account themes have been enabled, each sub-account also includes a Themes link. To open the Theme Editor for a sub-account, click the Sub-Accounts link to locate and open the sub-account, then click the sub-account's Themes link.
View Theme Sections
The Themes page displays all available templates and saved themes for your institution. 
All default themes for Canvas display in the Templates section. Default templates are used as a starting point for admins to create their own themes and cannot be deleted. 
Once a theme is saved in the account, the page displays the My Themes section. My Themes shows all themes saved for the account. 
Open Theme
To open and view any theme, hover over the theme and click the Open in Theme Editor button.
Create Theme
To create a theme, open and modify your preferred template, or click the Add Theme button. You can also create a theme based on a saved template. 
View Current Theme
Once a theme is applied to the account, the theme is marked as the current theme. The current theme includes a green bar and check mark icon below the name of the theme. If an account includes multiple saved themes, the active theme is ordered first. 
To apply a different theme, open and apply any other saved theme or create a new theme for the account.
View Multiple Active Themes
If multiple themes display an information icon, each theme includes the same set of values that are being applied as the current theme. To delete one of the themes, locate the theme and click the Delete icon. 
Delete Theme
To delete a saved theme, click the Delete icon. 
Note: The current theme cannot be deleted. To delete the current theme, open and apply any other saved theme or create a new theme for the account.
