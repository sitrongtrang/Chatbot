How do I use an elementary-level theme in a course as an instructor
View Course Font
Canvas displays a new font, Balsamiq Sans, in the Global Navigation Menu, Course Navigation Menu, and Breadcrumbs bar. 
Note: If the feature preview is turned off, the font changes from Balsamiq Sans to the Canvas default, Lato.
View Rich Content Editor
The Balsamiq Sans font also displays in the Rich Content Editor. You can also select the font Architect's Daughter from the Format menu in the menubar.
View Course Navigation Links
If your course has not customized the Course Navigation Menu, visible links default to Home, Announcements, Grades, Modules, and links for LTI tools.
All other links will display the Visibility icon for instructors, which means they will not display in Course Navigation for students.
To change what displays in the Course Navigation menu, you can manage Course Navigation links.
Notes: 
If you have already customized the Course Navigation Menu in your course, enabling the Canvas Elementary Theming feature option will not modify your Course Navigation Menu links.
Announcements and Modules links will not display to students if content has not been added to those pages.
