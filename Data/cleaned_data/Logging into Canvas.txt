Logging into Canvas
Find Your School's Canvas URL
You can use our Canvas URL search page to search for and find your institution or school's Canvas URL. To find your school's Canvas URL, be as specific as possible with the name of your school and try alternative names, such as the name of your school district, abbreviations, or longer institution names.
Verify Canvas URL
Verify that you are using the correct Canvas URL for your school or institution. If you do not know which URL to use, you may need to contact your institution's IT department.
Note: Depending on your institution, you may need to log in via Single Sign On (SSO). This means you may need to enter your username and password on a login page that displays differently than the image above. For more information on logging into your institution's SSO page, contact your IT department.
Verify Username & Password
Verify that you are using the correct username and password.
If you use more than one Canvas URL, make sure you are using the correct login and password for each Canvas URL. 
If your login and password were given to you from your institution and you are having trouble logging in, please contact your institution. (Your institution may have changed your login credentials.)
If you do not have a login and password, you may need to create an account.
