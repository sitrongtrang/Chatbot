How do I reset my password as an instructor
Email Errors
If you enter your email address and never get a password reset email, review the following password tips.
Have you typed your email address correctly? Sometimes email addresses can be misspelled. Email addresses need to be entered exactly as they were registered.
Are you accessing the correct Canvas URL? You will not get the reset email if you are trying to reset your password on a site where you are not enrolled (such as canvas.instructure.com instead of myinstitution.instructure.com).
Is your Canvas email sponsored by your institution? If your mail email address is part of a campus firewall system that blocks emails from mass senders, you won't be able to receive the email. Contact your institution's IT department for assistance.
Are you the owner of your email address? If your email address is owned by someone else and you can't receive email for that address, you won't be able to get the reset email. Contact the owner of the email address for assistance.

Note: If your login screen does not show the password reset link, contact your institution for assistance.
