Choose the Outcome from the listed Outcomes. Set the mastery level by typing in the percent field. The mastery level is the percentage score that a student has to earn before you consider the student to have mastered the outcome. For example, a mastery score of 60 means that the student has to earn a 60% or higher on the aligned quiz questions. This score is only calculated using questions from the aligned question bank.
