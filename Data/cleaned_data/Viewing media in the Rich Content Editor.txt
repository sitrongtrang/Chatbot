Viewing media in the Rich Content Editor
Check Browser Compatibility and Computer Requirements
Media added to a course using the Rich Content Editor may not play if you are using an outdated browser or do not meet certain computer requirements. Verify browser compatibility and computer requirements using the Is My Browser up to Date? tool.
Verify File Restriction Settings with Instructor
If media does not play using a supported browser and was uploaded by the course instructor, verify with the instructor that the media is accessible to course users. 
By default, media that is recorded or uploaded by instructors using the Rich Content Editor is visible to users within the announcement, assignment, discussion, page, quiz, or syllabus. However, if the uploaded file's restriction settings were changed to unpublished or are outside of the file's visibility dates, users will not be able to play the media file.
