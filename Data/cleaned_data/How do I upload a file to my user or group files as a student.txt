How do I upload a file to my user or group files as a student
Upload File
In user or group files, click the Upload button.
Open File
Click the title of the file(s) you want to upload and click the Open button.
Upload Files via Drag and Drop
Some web browsers contain a feature that allows the user to add to files by simply dragging and dropping the files from a file window directly into the Canvas file repository. Click the title of the file you wish to add and drag the file to your open browser. Your file will automatically upload.
Replace Duplicate File
If a file with the same name already exists in the folder where you are uploading your file, you will be asked if you want to replace or rename it. 
To rename the file, click Change Name button. This option will create a duplicate copy of the file with a different name.
To replace the file, click the Replace button.

A progress bar will appear at the top of screen tracking the progress of your file upload.
