How do I view Announcements as an observer
Open Announcements from Course Card Dashboard
If there are announcements in a course, you can quickly access the course announcements page from your Canvas dashboard. On the course card, click the Announcements icon. 
View Recent Announcements on Course Home Page
If enabled by the course instructor, the course home page may display recent announcements. To view an announcement, click the announcement.
Open Announcements
In Course Navigation, click the Announcements link.
View Announcements
On the Announcements page, you can view all the announcements in a course. Announcements are listed in reverse chronological order where newest announcements display first and older announcements display towards the bottom.
Each announcement displays a title, the picture of the user who posted the announcement, an unread indicator near unread announcements, the announcement post date, and the number of unread/total replies in the announcement.
To mark all announcements as read, click the Mark all as read button.
Note: If an announcement shows the letter U in place of a profile picture, the announcement was imported or copied from another course in Canvas. Additionally, copied announcements do not include a posted date and time.
Filter Announcements
To filter the announcement list to display all or only unread announcements, click to select an option in the Filter by drop-down menu. To search for an announcement according to its title, enter keywords in the Search field.
