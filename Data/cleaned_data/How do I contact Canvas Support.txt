In some cases, the Help Menu may be disabled altogether. If you do not see a Help menu in Canvas, use the support resources provided by your institution or contact your institution's IT department. If your question can be shared publicly, you may consider asking the Canvas Community.
You can also use the Instructure Community resources to access the Canvas user guides, release notes, known issues, Canvas questions and answers, resource documents, and more. 
Learn more about using the Instructure Community in the Community Guides.
