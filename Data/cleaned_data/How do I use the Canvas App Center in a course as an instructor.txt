How do I use the Canvas App Center in a course as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Apps
Click the Apps tab.
View App Center
The App Center shows all apps available in your course. You can also filter by installed and not installed, or use the search field to locate a specific app. 
View App
To view a quick description of an app, hover over the app. To view all details, click the app. 
View App Details
On the details page, you can view a description of the app. When you are ready to install the app with the proper credentials, you can add the app as a tool for your course.
Note: The Canvas App Center does not always contain all the information about an app. You may want to visit the Edu App Center for complete information about the external app you want to configure.
View App Configurations
To view existing apps and configurations in your course, click the View App Configurations button.
View Account-Level Apps
You can view all configured apps in your course. 
Apps that have been configured by your Canvas admin at the account level display a Lock icon. You can view the placement of the app by clicking the Information icon. The placement shows the location(s) of the app, such as Course Navigation or the Rich Content Editor, so you know where it appears in your course.
Manage Course-Level Apps
To view configurations for a course-level external app, click the app's Settings icon. To edit the app, click the Edit link. To view placements for the app, click the Placements link. To Delete the app, click the Delete link.
View App Placements
App Placements shows the places in Canvas where your app can be used.
Note: You may see a No Placements Enabled message. This message indicates that the app does not have any specified placements within Canvas. However, the app will still work as intended.
