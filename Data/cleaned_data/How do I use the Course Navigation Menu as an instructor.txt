How do I use the Course Navigation Menu as an instructor
View Course Navigation Menu
The active link is highlighted with different color text and a line indicator. This highlight helps you quickly identify the feature area you are currently viewing in Canvas. 
Links that are hidden to students are indicated by the Visibility icon. A link may be hidden to students because the feature area has no content or because the link is disabled.
The Home page is part of Course Navigation and displays the Course Home Page. 
By default, new courses show links leading to the index pages for the following fourteen areas:
Announcements
Assignments
Discussions
Grades
People
Pages
Files
Syllabus
Outcomes
Quizzes
Modules
Conferences
Collaborations
Settings 
Note: Configured external (LTIâ€©) tools may create additional Course Navigation links. However, these links do not display the visibility icon. You can disable Course Navigation links for LTI Tools in course settings, and the link will no longer display in the Course Navigation menu for you or your students.
