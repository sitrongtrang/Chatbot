How do I create a new course from the Dashboard as an instructor
Open Dashboard
In the Global Navigation Menu, click the Dashboard link.
Create New Course
In the Dashboard sidebar, click the Start a New Course button. You may need to scroll down to see this button.
Note: If you do not see this button in Canvas, your institution has disabled this feature. 
Add Course Details 
In the Which account will this course be associated with? drop-down menu, select the account where you want the course to be organized. You can only select accounts that contain courses where you have active enrollments. If this drop-down menu does not display, your institution has restricted the option for instructors to select accounts for new courses.
In the Course Name field, enter the name for your course. A course code is automatically created based on the first string of connected characters in the course name. If allowed by your institution, the course code can be changed in Course Settings.
To create the course, click the Create button. To cancel course creation, click the Cancel button.
Note: Course content license and course visibility options are set to private by default. These options can be changed in Course Settings.
View Course
View the new course. Depending on your institution's preference, you can use either the Course Setup Checklist or the Canvas Course Setup Tutorial to populate your course.
