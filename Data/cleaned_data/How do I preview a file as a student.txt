How do I preview a file as a student
Open File
In user, group, or course files, click the name of the file you want to preview.
Note: Some instructors will lock files or folders so students can't access them. Also, some file types may not render a preview.
Open File via Toolbar
You can also click the line item for the file and click the View icon.
Preview File
The preview toolbar displays the file and file information details, as well as a link to download the file.
For documents, you can scroll through the document, zoom in and out, and view the document in full screen.
