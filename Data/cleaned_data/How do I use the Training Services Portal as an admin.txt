Open Help Menu
In the Canvas Global Navigation menu, click the Help link.
Note: Depending on your institution, the Help link name and icon may vary.
Open Training Services Portal
Click the Training Services Portal link.
Notes:
The Training Services Portal is only available to admin-, instructor-, and designer-based roles or users without an assigned role
If the Training Services Portal link does not display in your Help menu, you must enable it in account settings.
Authorize Account
To use the Training Services Portal, you must authorize the Training Portal to access your Canvas account. 
Two modals display when accessing the Training Portal the first time. To authorize use of your account, click the Authorize buttons. In the future, only the Canvas Training Portal Authorization modal will display. 
Note: If you are not authenticated in your Canvas Instance, you will be prompted to enter your Canvas URL before accessing the Training Portal.
