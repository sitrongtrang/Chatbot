How do I view my Canvas groups as a student
Open Groups
In Global Navigation, click the Groups link, then view your current groups. To view all your groups, click the All Groups link.
View Groups
Groups are organized into Current Groups and Previous Groups.
View Current Groups
Current Groups are groups in courses that are part of the current semester or term. You can view the name of the group and the course name for the group. If a course includes a term date, the term date displays next to the course name. Depending on access settings for a course, Current Groups can also display groups in courses that have been published but have not yet started.
Groups that are available to you display linked text. These groups are associated with current courses. To open a group, click the name of the group.
View Previous Groups
Groups listed under the Previous Groups heading are groups that are part of courses that have concluded. Students cannot view group material nor interact with the group after the course is concluded.
Note: Some institutions may not allow previous groups to display in the Courses page.
