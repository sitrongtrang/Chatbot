How do I use the Dashboard as a student
Open Dashboard
In Global Navigation, click the Dashboard link.
View Dashboard
The Dashboard is your landing page in Canvas. Depending on your institution, your Dashboard may default to one of three views: Card View, List View, or Recent Activity View.
Card View: displays course cards for quick access to all your favorite courses (the same courses display in the Courses link from the Global Navigation Menu)
List View: displays all course to-do items in an agenda view
Recent Activity View: displays all recent activity for all courses
View Global Announcement
The Dashboard may also include global announcements, which are announcements created by your institution. To remove the announcement from your dashboard, click the Remove icon.
View Dismissed Announcement
If you dismiss a global announcement, you can view dismissed announcements on the Global Announcements page.
Change Dashboard View
To change your Dashboard view, click the Options menu and select your preferred viewing option.
View Dashboard Sidebar
When set to Card View or Recent Activity View, the Dashboard also includes a sidebar. The sidebar includes a To Do list, upcoming assignments, links to recent feedback, and buttons for creating a course or viewing grades. Learn more about using the sidebar.
