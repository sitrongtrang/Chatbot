How do I use the Dashboard as an observer
Open Dashboard
In Global Navigation, click the Dashboard link.
View Dashboard
The Dashboard is your landing page in Canvas. Depending on your institution, your Dashboard may default to one of two views: Card View or Recent Activity View.
Card View: displays course cards for quick access to all your favorite courses (the same courses display in the Courses link from the Global Navigation Menu)
Recent Activity View: displays all recent activity for all courses
View Student Dashboards
To filter your dashboard by student, click the Student drop-down menu, then click the student's name. The dashboard view displays based on your student's dashboard view.
View Global Announcement
The Dashboard may also include global announcements, which are announcements created by your institution. To remove the announcement from your dashboard, click the Remove icon.
View Dismissed Announcement
If you dismiss a global announcement, you can view dismissed announcements on the Global Announcements page.
Change Dashboard View
To change your Dashboard view, click the Options menu and select your preferred viewing option.
