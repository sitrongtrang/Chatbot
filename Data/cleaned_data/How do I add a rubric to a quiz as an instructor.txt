Open Quizzes
In Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link.
Open Quiz
Click the name of the quiz.
Show Rubric
Click the Options icon and select the Show Rubric link. 
Add Rubric
Click the Add Rubric button.
Find a Rubric
To find an existing rubric, click the Find a Rubric link. 
You can find rubrics that were created in previous quizzes as well as rubrics created in other courses where you have an instructor role. 
Select Rubric
In the first column, select a course or account. In the second column, locate and click the name of a rubric. You can view the criteria and points in each rubric. To select a rubric for the quiz, scroll to the bottom of the rubric and click the Use This Rubric button.
Edit Rubric
To reopen the rubric and select rubric settings, click the Edit icon.
Create New Rubric
If you can't find an existing rubric to use for the quiz, you can create a new rubric for your quiz. New rubrics are saved in your course for future use. 
Select Rubric Settings
Once you have added a rubric, you can select several options for the rubric.
If you want to write free-form comments to students in SpeedGrader, select the I'll write free-form comments... checkbox. If this option is selected, no ratings are used to assess the student and criterion values are assigned manually.
If you want to remove points from the rubric, select the Remove points from rubric checkbox. If this option is selected, no points are associated with the rubric, but students can still be rated using the rubric criterion.
If you have the Learning Mastery Gradebook enabled but you don't want outcome results posted to the Learning Mastery Gradebook, select the Don't post Outcomes results to Learning Mastery Gradebook checkbox. If this option is selected, students will be able to see rubric and outcome results in the Grades and submission details pages but results will not be posted to the Learning Mastery Gradebook.
If you don't want students to see the score total for the rubric, select the Hide score total for assessment results checkbox. Students can still see the point values for each criterion, but the total score will not be shown at the bottom of the rubric. This option applies to students when they view rubrics from the Grades page.

To edit the rubric, click the Edit icon. To replace the rubric with an existing rubric, click the Search icon. To delete the rubric from the assignment, click the Delete icon.

Copy Rubric
If you try to edit a rubric that has been used in more than one assignment (assignment, graded discussion, or quiz), Canvas generates a warning message that the rubric can't be edited. This message means that the rubric can't be edited directly, but you can create a copy of the rubric. 
To create a copy of the rubric, click the OK button. Canvas will create a copied version of the rubric. The edited version will automatically replace the previous rubric in the quiz. 
The copied rubric will also be saved in the course rubrics list for future use. 
Student View
Students can view the rubric for the quiz on the Submission Details page, which is accessible from the Grades page.
