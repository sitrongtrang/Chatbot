How do I weight the final course grade based on assignment groups as an instructor
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Open Assignment Groups Weights Settings
Click the Assignments Options icon and select the Assignment Groups Weights option.
Weight Final Grade
Click the Weight final grade based on assignment groups checkbox. 
Set Weights
Enter the percentage weights for each of the different Assignment Groups you created. The percentage weights you specify here will determine how Canvas calculates the final grade for your course. These percentages can be changed at any time and students will be notified when any changes are made. The weights will show up in the Gradebook for both students and instructors.
Click the Save button.
Notes: 
Assignment group weights can include decimals.
The total percentage of all assignment groups can be set above or below 100%.
