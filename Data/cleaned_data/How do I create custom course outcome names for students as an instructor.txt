How do I create custom course outcome names for students as an instructor
Open Outcomes
In Course Navigation, click the Outcomes link.
Create New Outcome
If you want to create a friendly name while creating a new Outcome, click the New Outcome button.
Create Friendly Name
Enter a name for the outcome in the Name this outcome field. This is the name of the outcome that will also appear in the Learning Mastery Gradebook.
To create a custom outcome name for students, enter a name in the Friendly name (optional) field. 
Edit Outcome
If you want to edit an existing outcome and add a friendly name, locate and click the name of the outcome. Click the Edit Outcome button.
You can only edit outcomes that have not yet been used to assess a student. If the Edit Outcome button is grayed out, you cannot edit the outcome.
Note: Your friendly name will not appear as part of the Outcomes Index page.
