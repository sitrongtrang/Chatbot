What are question banks
Open Question Banks
Account-level question banks are question banks created and stored at the account level. This allows users to access and use general content for quizzes.
When Would I Use Account-Level Question Banks?
Account-level questions banks can be used to create institutional or departmental question repositories. For example, if the English department offers several courses to teach basic grammar rules to students, the department can create a sub-account level question bank. Instructors can then access the question banks to offer the same evaluation to students in different courses.
