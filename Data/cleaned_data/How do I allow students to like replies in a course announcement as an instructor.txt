How do I allow students to like replies in a course announcement as an instructor
Open Announcements
In Course Navigation, click the Announcements link.
Add Announcement
Click the Add Announcement button.
Allow Liking
Click the Allow liking checkbox.
Set Liking Options
When allowing announcement likes, you can limit the users who can like to graders only.
To limit the liking functionality to only graders in the course, click the Only graders can like checkbox. When this checkbox is selected, only users with the Edit Grades permission can see the Like link. However, all users will still see the total number of likes for each reply.
Note: Announcement replies are sorted in descending order. 
Save Announcement
Click the Save button.
