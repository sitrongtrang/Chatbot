How do I use the Canvas course setup tutorial as an instructor
Open User Settings
In Global Navigation, click the Account link. Then click the Settings link.
Enable Tutorial
Locate your user feature options. To enable the course setup tutorial, click the Course Set-up Tutorial icon.
Open Course
To open your course, click the Courses link in Global Navigation. Then click the name of the course you want to view.
View Tutorial
New courses open to the Home Page, which displays the Home Page tutorial. The tutorial tells you the purpose of the page and provides links to related Canvas guides.
Continue Tutorial
To view the course setup tutorial for a different page in Canvas, click the link for the page in Course Navigation.
The tutorial content updates to reflect the page you are viewing.
Collapse Tutorial
By default, the tutorial is expanded in each page. Once you read the content in the tutorial, you may want to collapse the tutorial as some pages contain content behind the tutorial. The state of the tutorial is persistent across Canvas pages, so if you collapse the tutorial in one page, it will stay collapsed until expanded again.
To expand or collapse the tutorial, click the Arrow icon.
End Tutorial
To end the tutorial at any time, click the Don't Show Again button. 
Note: Ending the tutorial means that the tutorial will no longer display in any of your courses.
Click the Okay button.
