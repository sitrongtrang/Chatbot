How do I use peer review discussions in a course as an instructor
View Peer Review Discussions
When you or a TA create a peer review graded discussion, you can assign peer reviews manually or you can have Canvas assign them automatically.
When a peer review has been assigned, students can view a notification in their Dashboard To Do sidebar or Activity Stream. Students will also receive an email notification.
View Peer Review Comments
To complete a peer review, students must review the discussion and leave a comment on the submission details page.
Students cannot view previously submitted comments by any other reviewers, including comments by TAs or other instructors.
You can also assign a rubric to the graded discussion. If the discussion includes a rubric, students must only complete the rubric to complete the peer review. However, you can choose to ask your students to also leave a comment in the comment sidebar. The rubric score is used for an assessment opinion only; you must review the graded discussion and assign the final grade.
View Peer Review Grades
Students do not receive a grade for completing a peer review. If you want to assign extra points for peer reviews, you can create a No Submission assignment in the Gradebook and assign points manually. The Peer Review page for the discussion will show the names of students who have completed the peer review.
