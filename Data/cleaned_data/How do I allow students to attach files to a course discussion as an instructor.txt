How do I allow students to attach files to a course discussion as an instructor
Open Discussions
In Course Navigation, click the Discussions link.
Open Settings
Click the Settings icon.
Edit Discussion Settings
Check the Attach files to discussions checkbox. To save discussion settings, click the Save Settings button.
Note: Disabling this option will restrict students from attaching files in discussion topics, discussion replies, and discussions within course groups. This option does not affect your students' ability to add a file using the Rich Content Editor.
