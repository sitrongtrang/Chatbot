How do I generate a pairing code for an observer as a student
Open User Settings
In Global Navigation, click the Account link, then click the Settings link.
Pair with Observer
Click the Pair with Observer button.
Note: If the Pair with Observer button doesn't display in your User Settings, please contact your institution for assistance with pairing with an observer.
Copy Pairing Code
Copy the six-digit alphanumeric pairing code. You will need to share the code with the observer who will link to your account. The pairing code will expire after seven days or its first use.
To close the window, click the OK button.
Note: Pairing codes are case sensitive.
