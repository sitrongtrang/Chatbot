How can I use Canvas on my mobile device as an instructor
Mobile Browsers
You can access Canvas from any browser on your Android/iOS device. However, mobile browsers are not supported, and features may not function as expected compared to viewing Canvas in a fully supported desktop browser. 
On mobile devices, Canvas is designed to be used within Canvas mobile applications. Canvas pages within a mobile browser are only supported when an action in the app links directly to the browser, such as when a student takes certain types of quizzes. Support is not extended to pages that cannot currently be used in the app, such as Conferences or Collaborations.
Additionally, Canvas offers limited support for native mobile browsers on tablet devices. For details, please reference the limited-support mobile browser guidelines.
Mobile Applications
We are actively improving our native mobile applications to support as many Canvas features as possible. Instructure has four native mobile applications for instructors free for download on both phones and tablets.
Canvas Teacher App (iOS 10.0+, Android 5.0+). This app allows you to manage course content and grade student submissions on the go. Syncs with SpeedGrader and the Gradebook. View Canvas Teacher mobile features by version and device.
You can learn more about mobile applications in the Canvas Mobile Guides.
