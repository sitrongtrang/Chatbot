How do I view Announcements as a student
Open Announcements
In Course Navigation, click the Announcements link.
View Announcements Page
The Announcements Index page displays global settings at the top of the page, followed by the individual announcements. 
Announcements are listed in reverse chronological order with the newest appearing first and the older announcements appearing towards the bottom.
Filter Announcements
To view all or only unread announcements, click the filter drop-down menu. 
To search for an announcement by title, enter keywords in the Search field.
View Announcements
Each announcement includes the title of the announcement, the picture of the user who posted the announcement, an unread indicator near unread announcements, the announcement post date, and the number of unread/total replies in the announcement.
To mark all the announcements as read, click the Mark all as read button.
Note: If an announcement shows the letter U in place of a profile picture, the announcement was imported or copied from another course in Canvas. Additionally, copied announcements do not include a posted date and time.
