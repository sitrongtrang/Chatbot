What quiz types can I create in a course
Create Graded Quiz
A graded quiz is the most common quiz, and Canvas automatically creates a column in the grade book for any graded quizzes you build. After a student takes a graded quiz, certain question types will be automatically graded. You can also view quiz results for graded quizzes in SpeedGrader or from the quiz results page.
Create Practice Quiz
A practice quiz can be used as a learning tool to help students see how well they understand the course material. Practice quizzes are not a graded quiz type. Students do not receive a grade for practice quizzes, even though the quiz results display the number of points earned in the quiz. Practice quiz results do not display on the student grades page and must be viewed from the submission details page. You can also view quiz results for practice quizzes.
Create Graded Survey
A graded survey allows the instructor to give students points for completing the survey, but it does not allow the survey to be graded for right or wrong answers. Graded surveys have the option to be anonymous. You can also view survey results for graded surveys from the quiz details page or in SpeedGrader.
Create Ungraded Survey
An ungraded survey allows you to get opinions or other information from your students, but students do not receive a grade for their responses. With ungraded surveys, you can make responses anonymous. Ungraded surveys are not a graded quiz type. You can also view survey results for ungraded surveys.
