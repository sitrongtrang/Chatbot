How do I change the color for a grading status in the Gradebook as an instructor
Open Grades
In Course Navigation, click the Grades link.
View Status Colors
Click the Settings icon. 
To change the status colors, click the View Options tab and click the Edit icon.
Change Color Status
Select the new color for the status. The check mark indicates the selected color, and the hex color code displays in the text field. 
If you want to use a color not shown in the window, you can enter the color's hex code directly in in the text field. The hex field will display a warning icon if the hex code is not valid.
