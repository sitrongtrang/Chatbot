How do I add an assignment from the Calendar as an instructor
Open Calendar
In Global Navigation, click the Calendar link.
Add Assignment
Click the Add icon.
Enter Assignment Details
Enter a title and due date for the new assignment. In the Calendar drop-down menu, select the course for the assignment. In the Group drop-down menu, select the assignment group. 
If your institution has enabled a student information system (SIS) integration, you can enable the assignment to sync to the SIS by selecting the Sync to SIS checkbox.
To publish the assignment, toggle the Publish icon. If you choose not to publish, the assignment will still be created and remain unpublished.
Submit Assignment
To view the assignment page and edit the assignment details, click the More Options button. Otherwise, click the Submit button.
