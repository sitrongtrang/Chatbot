How do I customize visibility options for course content as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Open Course Details
Click the Course Details tab.
Confirm Course Visibility
In the Visibility options, confirm the course visibility is set correctly. Content visibility is defined by the course visibility option.
Note: If the Visibility option cannot be changed, you do not have permission to manage visibility settings. Please contact your Canvas administrator or Canvas Support for assistance.
Customize Content Visibility
Click the Customize checkbox.
Set Content Visibility
Currently the only content available for customization is the Syllabus and Files. The default is set to the same option shown for course visibility. 
In the Syllabus and Files menu, select the visibility option you want to set:
If course visibility is set to Course, content visibility can be set to Course, Institution, or Public.
‪If course visibility is set to Institution, content visibility can be set to Institution or Public.
‪If course visibility is set to Public, the entire course is already public so content visibility can only be set to Public.
