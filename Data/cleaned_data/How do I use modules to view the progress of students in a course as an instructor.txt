How do I use modules to view the progress of students in a course as an instructor
Open Modules
In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
View Student Progress
Modules displays an overview of each module and the content within each module. Any completion requirements are listed next to the module content item. Prerequisite requirements are posted at the top of the module.
To view student progress in your course, click the View Progress button.
Select Student
When opening the View Progress window, Canvas will always default to show the first student in your course (listed alphabetically by last name).
To view progress for another student, click the student's name in the Student Progress list. 
View Module Progress
The Module Progress window shows the progress of each student in your course. Modules can be completed, in progress, locked, or unlocked. 
In Progress: the student has started but not finished the module
Locked: the module cannot yet be accessed by the student because of completion or prerequisite requirements
Completed: the student has completed the module, or the module has no completion requirements
Unlocked: the student can access but has not yet started the module
To learn more about what a student is accessing, visit the access report lesson.
