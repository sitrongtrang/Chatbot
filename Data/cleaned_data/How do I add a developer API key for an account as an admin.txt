How do I add a developer API key for an account as an admin
Open Account

Open Developer Keys
In Account Navigation, click the Developer Keys link.
Add Developer Key
Click the Add Developer Key button.
Add API Key
Click the Add API Key option.
Enter Key Settings
Enter the settings for the developer API key:
Key Name: Usually your app or company name. This field will be shown when users are asked to approve access to their Canvas account on your behalf.
Owner Email: The email of the person who owns the developer tool.
Redirect URIs: The domains where tokens are requested. These URIs are not your Canvas URL. To avoid mixed content browser concerns, use https.
Redirect URI (Legacy): The URI for the key redirect. This field allows you to set the previous URI for a tool. Eventually this field will be removed.
Vendor Code (LTI 2): A unique registered code which identifies the vendor or developer of the third-party tool. This is specifically for LTI 2 tools and apps. 
Icon URL: The URL of the icon for your developer tool. This URL is presented to the user to approve authorization for your tool. To avoid mixed content browser concerns, use https.
Notes: Any notes about the developer key, such as the reason it was created.
Test Cluster Only: Creates a developer key that can only be used in the Canvas test environment.
Enforce Scopes: Allows you to customize access for the key. Otherwise, the key will have access to all endpoints available to the authorizing user.
