How do I create assignment columns for non-submission assignments in the Gradebook as an instructor
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link. 
Add Assignment
Click the Add Assignment button.
Enter Assignment Details
Enter a name and description for your assignment, as well as any other assignment details.
Note: No Submission and On Paper assignments still appear to students on their Assignments page. To avoid confusion, it is best to make a note in the description about the assignment so students will know whether or not a submission is required and if so, how they are supposed to submit it. 
Set Submission Type
In the Submission Type drop-down menu, select the No Submission option or On Paper option.
Save and Publish
If you are ready to publish your assignment, click the Save & Publish button. If you want to create a draft of your assignment and publish it later, click the Save button.
Note: Along with published assignments, the Gradebook will display unpublished assignments by default, but you can not enter grades for unpublished assignments.
Student View
When students view a no submission or on-paper assignment, they will not see the Submit Assignment button. They can view the details and point value for the assignment. The Submitting section will indicate whether the submission is on-paper or if no submission is required.
