How do I connect to web services outside of Canvas as a student
Open User Settings
In Global Navigation, click the Account link, then click the Settings link.
Link Services to Profile
When you register other web services with Canvas, you can integrate your account with services you already use. Each of these services also generates a contact method for other people in your course or group. 
If Profiles is enabled for your account, and you want to show any of your registered web services on your profile page, click the Let fellow course/group members... checkbox. You can select specific services to display by editing your profile.
Note: If you do not have a profile page, your institution has not enabled this feature.
