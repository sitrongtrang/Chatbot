How do I add an external app in a course as an instructor
View Canvas App Center
Located in Course Settings, the App Center is your gateway to powerful teaching tools that are easily integrated into a Canvas account or Canvas course. These apps can be installed into Canvas with one click.
View Edu App Center
If your institution does not have the Canvas App Center configured, the Edu App Center is an index lists of all current Canvas-compatible External Apps and is updated frequently.
Each app provides details that you can use to configure apps manually, by URL, or by XML.
Use Vendor-Provided Tools
Many vendors use their own external tool integrations. Vendors will have their own landing pages with instructions on how to configure and use the tool. Some vendors may provide a common cartridge that will import the tools for you. However, any app used by a vendor will require a key and secret provided by the vendor and need to be configured manually, by URL, or by XML.
