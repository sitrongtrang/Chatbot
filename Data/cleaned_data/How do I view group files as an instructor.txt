How do I view group files as an instructor
Open Groups
In Global Navigation, click the Groups link, then click the name of the group.
Open Files
In Groups Navigation, click the Files link.
View Group Files
All files can be viewed by all group members. 
Please note that all group members hold the same permissions, so one group member can delete or move files uploaded by another group member. Group files are published by default. 
You can view the quota for your group and what percentage of that quota has been used. Files that have been submitted as group assignments do not apply to the group quota.
If you want to see the Files for all your groups, click the All My Files link. Canvas will display your User Files page with all group folders displayed below your user files.
