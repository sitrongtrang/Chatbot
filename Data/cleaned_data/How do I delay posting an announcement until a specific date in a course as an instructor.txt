How do I delay posting an announcement until a specific date in a course as an instructor
Open Announcements
In Course Navigation, click the Announcements link.
Add Announcement
Click the Add Announcement button.
Add Availability Dates
To make your announcement available on a specific date or during a specific date range, enter the dates in the Available From field and Until field, or click the calendar icons to select dates. 
To add a time, click the Time drop-down menu. You can enter a time or select a time from the drop-down menu.
To reset the date and time fields, click the Reset button.
You are not required to enter dates in both of these fields, so if you want to delay your posting but do want your post to appear indefinitely, you can leave the Until field blank.
Notes: 
The Available From date is also the date the announcement is published.
If there is no Until date, the announcement remains visible.
Once the Until date is reached, the announcement is no longer visible to students.
Save Announcement
Click the Save button.
