Courses versus Sections
Courses are the virtual classroom where all the content resides, the place where students can learn and interact with the instructor and each other. Sections are a group of students that have been organized for administrative purposes. Students are enrolled in sections and sections are listed in courses. It is possible to place more than one section in course, but not possible to put sections within sections. 
Cross-Listing Sections
Cross-listing allows you to move section enrollments from individual courses and combine them into one course. This feature is helpful for instructors who teach several sections of the same course and only want to manage course data in one location. Section names do not change when they are cross-listed; the section is just moved to another course. Sections can only be in one course at a time. Once a section is cross-listed, you can re-cross-list the section into another course if necessary. Learn how to cross-list a section.
Course Status
Coursework is retained with the course, not with the section enrollments. Therefore, cross-listing should only be done in unpublished courses. If there are student submissions in the course when the section is cross-listed, the submissions and grades will not transfer to the new section. 
If you need to restore the enrollments, you can de-cross-list a section back to the course. If you need to retain student grades in the original course, you should export the Gradebook and import it into the original course before de-cross-listing the section.
Instructor Enrollments
Instructors are included as a part of the cross-listed section. Cross-listing removes the instructor's access to the original course and moves the instructor into the new course with the other users in the section. If you want an instructor to have access to the original course, you must add the instructor's enrollment to a separate section in the original course. 
If you allow instructors to cross-list their own sections, they can only de-cross-list a section back to the original course if they still have an enrollment in the original course. Otherwise they will have to contact you for assistance.
Cross-Listing Examples
In K12 institutions, cross-listing can be used for instructors who are teaching the same subject in more than one class. For instance, an instructor is teaching Algebra during 1st, 3rd, and 7th period. These periods can be set up in Canvas as three separate courses, and students are enrolled in the course according to which period they are taking. Rather than enter and manage course content three different times, two of the courses can have a section (or multiple sections) cross-listed into the third course before the course is published. So if the sections created in the courses for the 3rd and 7th periods were cross-listed into the course created for 1st period, the instructor only has to update the first course, which now includes all three periods as individual sections. 
In higher education, the same concept applies. Many times one course taught by one teacher is shown for course credit across multiple departments. If an English 1010 course is spread across four different departments with different names, institutions can create separate courses for each department's enrollments (e.g., English, Business, Psychology, and Education), then open those courses and cross-list their sections into one master course.
Managing one course with multiple sections provides flexibility for instructors all while managing content in one location. Instructors can use sections to create differentiated assignments and section-specific due dates, create self sign-up groups where students must all be in the same section, and specify that enrollments can only interact with other users in their section.

Add Question
With the Questions tab selected inside a new quiz, click the New Question button.
Set Name, Type, and Points
Quiz questions are not automatically numbered for instructors. To add a custom name to your quiz question, enter the name in the question text field. Custom names can help you identify quiz questions more easily. Regardless of the question name, students always see quiz questions in numerical order (i.e. Question 1, Question 2).
Click the drop-down menu and select the Formula question type.
Enter number of points the question is worth (quiz totals are calculated based on combined total of questions).
Note: Quiz point values support up to two decimal places. Entering more than two decimal places will round the point value to the nearest hundredth.
Edit Question Details
Type the question prompt text and formula with variables in brackets in the Rich Content Editor. You can include video, images, math equations, or flash activities. Click the Need help? link for more advanced options.
Note: If you need help adding a mathematical formula in the Rich Content Editor, please see the Math Editor lesson. You cannot use the letter "e" as a variable. It is a reserved mathematical constant.
Set Variable Definitions
After you have finished typing the formula in the Rich Content Editor, parameters to define the formula will appear. Set the variable definitions for the formula. Specify the minimum and maximum numbers for variable X. Setting a minimum will prevent a division by zero. 
Select decimal places in the drop-down menu, and click the Recompute button to verify that Canvas will insert a number into the formula that is within the variable definition. 
Set Formula Definitions
Type the formula definition in the formula field. Make sure the formula does not contain any brackets or equal signs. Select the Decimal Places drop-down menu to set the number of decimal places you want used for the result. Select the Save button to save your formula. 
Note: If you need help building formulas in the Formula Definition field, see the Canvas Formula Quiz Question Helper Functions resource document.
Recompute Solution
Once you've added a formula definition, you can go back to the Recompute button and watch the calculated variable process through the formula, creating the result. You can recompute as many times as you'd like. For instance, in this example, the number 79 acts for x and the result is -941. 
Set Possible Number of Solutions
In the Offer field, specify the number of possible solutions you want Canvas to generate. 
In the error margin of field, enter the margin of error for the student's answer. Responses are based on relative error in addition to absolute error. Margins of error can be created as a percentage or as a point value (up to three decimal places).
Click the Generate button to view final answer.
View Possible Solutions
Possible solutions will process according to the number of value combinations.
Provide Feedback
You can provide feedback for the question by clicking an answer comment field and entering text. The comment fields are color-coded to correspond with the type of answer the student provides. Green is for correct answer feedback, red is for incorrect answer feedback, and blue is for general question feedback.
Note: Any applicable feedback is visible as soon as a quiz is submitted and cannot be hidden from students.

Open Group
Click the Groups link, then click the name of the group.
Open Files
In Group Navigation, click the Files link.
View Group Files
All your group folders display in the left panel. View files in the right panel by clicking the name of a folder. 
You can view your group quota and what percentage of that quota has been used. Files that have been submitted as group assignments and group graded discussions do not apply to the user quota.
If you want to see the Files for all your courses and/or groups, click the All My Files link. Canvas will refresh the page to show your user files page with all courses and group folders.
Note: Files uploaded using the Rich Content Editor count toward your user storage quota.
The Groups folder creates folders based on default events in Canvas. Once you upload a file related to one of these areas, the folder and accompanying file will be created for you. 
The Submissions folder contains copies of your assignment submissions; assignments are organized by course folder and displayed alphabetically.
The Unfiled folder stores files that you attach to discussion topics or discussion replies (if attachments are allowed by your instructor).
Group files also includes any additional folders you create to organize your files, as well as any files not uploaded to a specific folder. Any files in the group folder that are not related to assignment submissions count toward your user quota.
All files can be viewed by all group members. Please note that all group members hold the same permissions, so one group member can delete or move files uploaded by another group member. Group files are published by default. 
Note: For group assignment submissions, if you submit a file that has previously been uploaded to the group, you can delete the previously uploaded file after it has been submitted and free up extra storage in your group files. However, to submit a previously uploaded file in group files, the file must be moved to the user files folder for the student submitting the assignment on behalf of the group, as the assignment submissions page can only access user files and not group files. How do I view Assignments as a student
Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the Assignments link.
Note: If the Assignments link is not available in Course Navigation, you can access course assignments through the Modules page.
View Assignments
In Assignments, you can view all the assignments in your course. 
By default, assignments are grouped by overdue assignments, upcoming assignments, undated assignments, and past assignments.
Overdue Assignments: assignments and discussions that are past the due date, are still available, have not been submitted, and have not been graded.
Upcoming Assignments: assignments, discussions, and quizzes that have an upcoming due date.
Undated Assignments: assignments, discussions, and quizzes that do not have a due date.
Past Assignments: assignments and discussions that are past the due date and either are not available, have been submitted, or have received a grade; quizzes that are past the due date.
Each assignment also includes an icon with the assignment type: assignment, discussion, or quiz.
Note: The Assignments page supports keyboard shortcuts. To view a window with a list of keyboard navigation shortcuts, press the Shift+Question Mark keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
View Assignment Summary
Each assignment displays the assignment name, any availability dates for the assignment, due date (if any), and the number of points the assignment is worth.
View Availability Dates
The first dates you may see are called availability dates. Sometimes your instructor only wants you to submit an assignment during a specified date range, so the available dates are the range of time that the assignment is accessible to you. 
If the assignment does not have a date listed, the assignment is open; you can submit the assignment at any time during your course. 
If the assignment says Available until [date], you can submit the assignment until the specified date. 
If the assignment says Not Available Until [date], the assignment is locked until the specified date.
If the assignment says Closed, the assignment cannot accept submissions. 
Note: If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 pm. 
View Due Dates
The second set of dates are the Due dates for each respective assignment. Any assignments submitted after the due date are marked as late; some instructors may deduct points for late submissions. Again, not all assignments may include a Due date. 
You can still submit late assignments before the Available until date.
Please be aware that the Due date may be before or on the Available date. 
Due dates also include a time. If your instructor does not set a due time, the listed date displays the course's default due time.
Filter Assignments
If your course includes Multiple Grading Periods, you can view assignments by grading period. You can search for an assignment by typing an assignment title or a keyword in the Search for assignment field. You can also group assignments by type.
Open Assignment
To view the details of an assignment, click the name of the assignment. 
View Open Assignment
When an assignment is open to you to submit at any time, you can view the due date, points, and the type(s) of submission(s) you can use for the assignment. Not all assignments may have a due date. 
You can also view additional details:
Instructions: any instructions that your instructor has about the assignment. Please note that you cannot download assignment instructions unless your instructor has included a link to download them. You can also print the screen or copy and paste the directions into a word processing program, or you can also view the assignment in the Canvas mobile app.
Rubric: any grading criteria that your instructor has provided for the assignment. An assignment may or may not include a rubric. Before submitting your assignment, you may want to review the assignment rubric.
For example, an assignment may have a due date but may not list any other dates. If you were to miss the due date, you could still submit the assignment for late credit before the last day of the course. If the assignment does not have a due date, you can submit the assignment at any time before the last day of the course.
To submit your assignment, click the Start Assignment button.
Note: You can always re-submit an assignment unless your instructor has set availability dates for the assignment.
View Assignment with Availability Dates
When an assignment is open to you during availability dates, you can view all available assignment information in addition to the specific dates the assignment is available to you. Availability dates may include a first available date (open date), last available date (locked or closed), or both dates to create an overall date range. The Due date may be before or on the last available date (if one is set).
If you were to miss the assignment submission due date, you could still submit the assignment until the last available date. Once the last date passes, you can no longer submit the assignment.
Note: While viewing the due date with 24 hours, an availability window will show. 
View Assignment with Limited Attempts
Your instructor may limit the number of submission attempts you are allotted for an assignment. If your assignment has a limited number of submissions, you can view the number of submission attempts you have made and the number of submission allowed for the assignment.
Once you have used all your submission attempts, the New Attempt button displays as disabled.
View Locked Assignment
An assignment can be locked before an instructor wants it open, or after a specific date has passed after the due date. When an assignment is locked, you can view the rubric (if any) and the assignment details. You can also view the date when the assignment will be open for submissions if it has not been opened yet.
View Closed Assignment
When an assignment is closed, you can still view the rubric, if any, and any existing submission details in the sidebar, but you can no longer view the assignment details or submit/re-submit the assignment. You can also view the date the assignment was locked to submissions.
Assignments close when they are only available until a specific date.How do I manage external app placements for a course as an instructor

Bulk Migrate Existing Quizzes as New Quizzes
If allowed by your institution, you can bulk migrate existing quizzes into New Quizzes by clicking the Import existing quizzes as New Quizzes checkbox. 
If your institution enables the quiz migration feature, question banks linked via a question group in Classic Quizzes will migrate to New Quizzes. If the quiz migration feature is not enabled by your institution, questions from question banks must be individually added before migrating to New Quizzes.
Notes: 
New Quizzes does not include a survey feature. Therefore, surveys migrated from Classic Quizzes come over as standard quizzes in New Quizzes.
After migration to New Quizzes, multiple dropdown questions display as matching questions.
Text No Question questions migrate to New Quizzes as Stimulus questions. An instructor must add a question in order for it to display in a quiz.
Question groups with manually created questions will migrate as item banks in New Quizzes.
If a quiz is migrated multiple times, Canvas uses smart merging to decipher the question bank content that should be retained. This process helps ensure all content is retained, such as in cases where multiple users may be making edits to a quiz at the same time.
Practice quizzes from Classic Quizzes can be migrated to New Quizzes. Once migrated, by default, the practice quizzes are displayed as zero points possible and are hidden from the Gradebook and Grades page.

Open Modules
In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
Add Course Modules
The Mastery Path process currently only originates from the course Modules page. Before you can designate source assignments and conditional items for a Mastery Path, all course assignments and pages should be developed and added to Modules as module items. Mastery Paths can be created from module structures in existing courses or new course content.
Indenting module items can be used to help organize the module's structure and visually show which items should be conditional items in a Mastery Path.
Graded assignments, graded discussions, or graded quizzes may be used as the source content for a Mastery Path. A student's source content score determines which conditional item(s) they are assigned. 
Any course item except for practice quizzes and ungraded surveys may be designated as a conditional item in a Mastery Path.
Notes: 
In Mastery Paths, module prerequisites and requirements are not required, but they are encouraged to guide course organization and conditional paths.
Files, External URLs, and External Tool module items cannot be used as conditional items in Mastery Paths.
Allow Page Content
Because content pages do not require grading, content pages cannot be used as source content and can only be added to a Mastery Path as conditional content. However, a page must be allowed for Mastery Paths before it can be added as a conditional item.
Add Conditional Items
A Mastery Path originates from an assignment assigned to everyone, such as a pre-test or an introductory assignment. 
The Mastery Paths configuration page allows you to add conditional content items to the source content item. Conditional content items are selected from the list of module items you have already added to the module. These items are then assigned to specific students through conditional rules in three scoring ranges. After the source content assignment has been graded (either manually or automatically), the student’s score designates which conditional item(s) they are assigned as a learning path.
Assign Items to Mastery Paths
By default, assignments in Canvas are assigned to Everyone, which means all students will be able to view the assignment in their Modules page. Once conditional content items have been added to a Mastery Path, the conditional assignments must be assigned to Mastery Paths. The Mastery Paths assignment designates the assignment for conditional release only, and the assignment will only display to students whose source content scores fall in a range that releases the conditional assignment to them.
Release Conditional Items
When you create Mastery Paths for your course, students see content added to their Modules page as they move through the course. When the course begins, they will only be able to see items that have been published and assigned to Everyone or assigned specifically to them. In contrast, courses that do not use Mastery Paths display all content in the Module, even if the content is locked.
Once a Mastery Path source assignment has been graded (either automatically by Canvas or manually in SpeedGrader), the conditional item(s) will automatically display in the student’s Modules page based on the source item’s scoring range.
If a Mastery Path source assignment scoring range includes an Or option, students must choose which conditional item(s) they wish to complete before proceeding. 
Notes: 
If you set a requirement that module items must be completed in order, when a student completes a Mastery Path that requires any manual grading, all subsequent module items will be locked for the student until the Mastery Path is graded.
If you regrade a source assignment after a student chooses a Mastery Path option, and the regrade puts the student in a different conditional item range, they will have to complete the conditional item(s) in the reassigned Mastery Path before advancing through the module.
View Student Path Assignment
When a student is assigned or selects a conditional item, the conditional assignment automatically adds the student’s name to the assignment as being differentiated to that student.
View Mastery Path Breakdown
Once students complete a source content item for a Mastery Path, you can view the Mastery Paths breakdown. Each scoring range includes a link that shows the number of students in each range. You can click the name of a student in the range, view the student’s source content submission and score, and send a message to the student.How do I use the student list to view student submissions in SpeedGrader as an instructor
Open SpeedGrader
Open SpeedGrader from any assignment, graded discussion, or quiz.
Open Student List
 To open the list of students, click the drop-down menu.
View Student List
SpeedGrader opens the assignment for the first student listed in the student list, arranged alphabetically by last name. However, you can choose to sort the student list by student name, submission date, or submission status.
When you view a submission, the student which student submission you are viewing in the student list compared to the total number of students. 
View Sections
If your course includes more than one section, students are displayed according to the section shown in the Gradebook. By default, the Gradebook shows all sections, though you can select a specific section to view. 
Viewing an assignment by section only displays submissions for that section and decreases the overall loading time for the assignment's data. When an assignment is opened in SpeedGrader, all values for that assignment are loaded and saved in the browser, including student submission data, any grades (including original grades for resubmitted assignments), rubrics, and comments. To improve performance, assignments in large courses should always be viewed by section.
Notes: 
Viewing by section is only available to instructors; admins cannot filter assignments by section.
Viewing by section is only available for group assignments if you assign grades to student individually.
When a section filter is applied in SpeedGrader, the same section filter also displays in the Gradebook.
View Assignment Indicators
For easy identification, each student is identified with an assignment submission status next to his or her name:
A green checkmark indicates the assignment has been graded
An orange dot indicates the assignment has not been graded or has been re-submitted
No checkmark and a grayed out name indicates the assignment has not been submitted
A gray checkmark indicates the assignment is moderated and has already been graded by another graderHow do I change the start and end dates for a course section as an admin

Limit Student Participation
If you do not want to let students participate in the course section outside of the section dates, select the Students can only participate in the course between these dates checkbox. Selecting this checkbox creates a section override and overrides the course dates. Students can only participate in the course section between the section dates, and the course section will be in a read-only state outside the course section dates.
This checkbox only affects student and observer roles; all other roles default to term access dates. 
Notes: 
Section override dates are only created if the Student Participation checkbox is selected. 
If the Student Participation checkbox is not selected, students can participate in the course section before and after the start and end date, and participation will always be determined by the course dates. If a course does not include course dates, dates are determined by term dates. 
When the Student Participation checkbox is not selected, the section dates determine the placement of the course in the Past, Current, or Future Enrollments list for students.

Open Account
Click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open Permissions
In Account Navigation, click the Permissions link.
Modify User Role and Permissions
In the Account Roles tab, create an account-level user role and allow the user to manage SIS data. If you do not want to create a new user role, you can use an existing user role and modify the permissions. 
Manually Add New User
You'll need to manually add a new user to manage the SIS data. You can use an existing user imported via SIS, but manually creating a new user is beneficial for security purposes. This new user will end up with only one permission, but that one permission grants the ability to create, modify, and delete many object types in Canvas.
Add User as Admin
To enable SIS permissions, add your admin as an administrative user to your account. Set the user with the user role where you enabled the SIS data permission.
Obtain API Access Token
Log out of Canvas and then log back in as the new user. In User Settings under Approved Integrations, add a new access token. Leave the expiration date blank unless you have a reason to specify a date. Learn how to obtain an API access token. 
Note: Be sure to save this API access token in a safe place. An API access token is effectively the same as a username and password, so treat it with similar security. Remember that the token created in your test environment will be replaced by the token created in your production environment during the next test environment refresh period.
Import Data via API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token>" 'https://<canvas_fqdn>/api/v1/accounts/self/sis_imports/<import_id>'
Practice importing data via the API. One API method is using cURL, a command line tool for transferring data that is supported on all operating systems (Windows, Linux, and OSX). The API can show you how to practice importing a test file and checking the status of a previous import.
Learn more about using the API to import data into Canvas.
Create Import Script
Using your preferred programming language, create an SIS script. An SIS script automatically synchronizes the users in your institution with your Canvas account. View the SIS script flowchart. 
The import script can be as simple or complex as your institution requires. Additionally, a variety of programming languages can be used to write your import script/program. 
Learn more about creating a Canvas SIS script. 
Export Data and Create Canvas CSV File
Export your SIS data in a Canvas CSV file format. Place the file(s  ) into a directory or folder that only contains CSV files ready to be imported. Depending on your SIS, this step may be automated. For more information on integration, please contact your Canvas Customer Success Manager.

Due to extensive variations among Student Information Systems (SIS),   this lesson cannot document one all-inclusive method for exporting data. However, here are a few possible data access methods that may be available to you:
API access: The SIS may provide an API in some form that will allow you to collect data.
Direct data (database  access): The SIS may allow direct database (or other direct data  ) access to your SIS data.
Report generation or data export: The SIS may have the ability to run reports or export data and have them delivered via email, from a web site/program, or saved to a folder.
Trigger or tracking events: The SIS may have the ability to run jobs on a triggered event. This type of tracking may be better suited to direct API manipulation of Canvas objects, but you could have a script/program that collects the triggered changes for batch updates at frequent intervals using SIS imports.
Once you know how to access your SIS data, a script/program could be written and used to manipulate and filter the data to match the format required for CSV SIS imports. In some cases, you may have to manually perform this step. You will need to work with your SIS administrative team or vendor to work out the best way to export data.
Note: While working with your SIS team, be sure to provide them with the Canvas CSV file format documentation, which may reduce the complexity of or eliminate the need for a script/program to prepare the data before the import.Pages Overview (Instructors)

In the Grades page, you can see how a student views their grades in the course. Students can view the name of the assignment, the due date, the submission date, the assignment status, the score or assignment submission type, the total number of points for the assignment, and any comments and rubrics, if any.
If allowed, the student can view distribution score details and graphs in the assignment scoring details. You will only see scoring details if more than five other students have submitted that assignment in the course. If you do not see the scoring details, then fewer than five students have submitted the assignment. As the instructor, you can hide grade distribution graphs.
Students can also view their assignment group score totals and their total grade for the course at the bottom of the Grades page. As the instructor, you can hide total scores. 
Notes: 
The student's grades shown in the Grades page may vary from the grades shown in the Gradebook. The student's Grades page is affected by hidden assignments, outstanding manually graded quiz questions, weighted assignment groups, and weighted grading periods. The Gradebook always contains the most current and accurate information about a student's current grade. 
When your course includes grading periods, the student Grades sidebar displays assignment groups when an individual grading period is being viewed. However, groups only display if the groups are active as part of the selected grading period. An assignment group displays if the group has at least one assignment due for the student in the selected grading period.
When grading periods are weighted and the All Grading Periods option is selected, the sidebar displays the weights of each grading period.
If an assignment allows multiple attempts, the Submitted column only displays the most recent submission date.

To view submission details, click the name of the group assignment.
View Group Assignment Comments
For group assignments, the submission details page may include individual comments added to a group assignment. 
By default, group assignments that award the same grade to all group members do not display any individual comments when grading group assignments in SpeedGrader. Likewise in SpeedGrader, you cannot add comments for an individual user in a group assignment.
However, the assignment details page allows you to leave individual comments for the student in group assignments where all members get the same grade. To reply to the student (and not all group members), do not select the Send Comment to the Whole Group checkbox. 
Individual comments also appear in the Submission Comments filter in Conversations.How do I lock a module as an instructor

Course-Level Roles
Course-level roles are roles with permissions that allow a user course-level access. Usually users with these roles cannot see more than what is in their Canvas courses.
Canvas provides five base course-level user roles that each include their own set of default permissions. You can manage the permissions according to the needs of your institution. You can also create custom course roles that are created from a base role. The Canvas base roles are:
Student : These users are permitted to submit assignments. This permission should not be turned off for this role. Student permissions are restricted, but they have enough permissions to access and interact with course materials. You may also grant other permissions to students.
Teacher: The teacher role grants a user course admin permissions, giving them control over their assigned course or courses. However, institutions can revise and limit these permissions as needed, depending upon the needs of your institution.
TA:These users have permissions similar to teachers except that TAs should not have access to SIS data. The TA role is meant to support the teacher role. Admins can manage TA permissions. For example, some institutions may permit TAs to grade student submissions.
Designer: These users are permitted to access and create course content, including announcements, assignments, discussions, and quizzes. Designer access to student information will vary from institution to institution. However, Designers cannot access grades. If your institution does not use Course Designers, you may choose to use this role as another TA user role that has more permissions than a regular TA.
Observer: This user role can be linked to a student user enrolled in a course. For example, parents, guardians, and/or mentors may wish to be linked to a student to view their course progress. Observers usually have the fewest permissions.
Note:All user permissions trickle down through an account. Additionally, all permissions modifications affect all users assigned to a role. You may need to create a custom course-level user role for users whose course-level permissions you would like to vary from others'.
Account-Level Roles
Account admins have the power to set permissions for all users in Canvas. Admins can create additional account-level roles with account-level permissions. The default permissions for account admins can include access to everything within the account, plus the ability to masquerade as a user.
Each sub-account has its own permissions page, so admins can create account-level roles within a sub-account and add sub-account permissions directly within the sub-account. Sub-account admins can only only manage permissions and settings for the sub-accounts to which they've been assigned. However, some permissions may not be available for sub-account users. To learn more, view the Account vs. Sub-Account Comparisons resource document. How do I upload a PDF to a page in a group as a student

Zero is the lowest possible score. For example, if a question is worth 4 points and there are 2 correct answers, Canvas divides 4 by 2 and awards 2 points for correct answers selected and deducts 2 points for incorrect answers. If a student selects 2 correct answers and 1 incorrect answer, the student will receive 2 points total (4 points awarded for correct answers and 2 points deducted for incorrect answers).
To award points only for an exact match, click the Exact Match option. The Exact Match option only awards points if all correct answers are selected and no incorrect answers are selected.

Grade breakdown responses are shown as the top 27%, middle 46%, and bottom 27%. The statistics also show submissions that have not yet been graded. However, if all scores are identical, a response category may show more than the percentage number of students (e.g., all students score 100%). 
Manually graded questions also include access to SpeedGrader for quick reference. 
View Discrimination Index
True/False and Multiple Choice quiz questions include an item discrimination index, which provides a measure of how well a single question can tell the difference between students who do well on an exam and those who do not. 
It divides students into three groups based on their score on the whole quiz: the top 27%, the middle 46%, and the bottom 27%. The number of correct answers from the bottom group is subtracted from the number of correct answers in the top group, then the total is divided by the size of the group.
Lower discrimination scores are scored +0.24 or lower; good scores are +0.25 or higher. An ideal discrimination index shows students who scored higher on the quiz getting the quiz question right, students who scored lower on the quiz getting the quiz question wrong, and students in the middle range on either side. A discrimination index of zero shows all students getting the quiz question right or wrong.
Ideally, students who did well on the exam should get the question right. If students do well on the overall exam but not on the question, the question itself may need to be revised.How do I embed media from an external source in the Rich Content Editor as an instructor

Open Account
In Global Navigation, click the Admin link, then click the name of the account.
Open SIS Import
In Account Navigation, click the SIS Import link.
Select File
Click the Choose File button and locate the SIS import file from your computer.
Select Import Type
In the Import Type menu, select the type of import you are uploading into Canvas. By default, the menu selects the CSV import option. 
Set Full Batch Update
If you want to create a full batch update, select the This is a full batch update checkbox. In the Term drop-down menu, select the term for the full batch update. With this option, any courses, sections, or enrollments with an SIS ID record in Canvas that is linked to the Term selected in the drop-down can be deleted. For enrollments, this option means the linked user and course/sections require SIS IDs. A Canvas record will be deleted if it is not included in the current import file. 
This option will only affect data created via previous SIS imports. Manually created courses, for example, won't be deleted even if they don't appear in the new SIS import.
Notes: Ensure you are aware of the associated risks before selecting this option.
Override UI Changes
If you want to override changes in the user interface (UI), select the Override UI changes checkbox. This change tells Canvas to overwrite any "sticky" data changed by users in their accounts with the data your are importing. 
If this box is NOT checked when doing a new users import, no name changes will be overridden in the UI, but if the user removed their listed email address it will be re-added but not marked default.
If this box IS checked when doing a new users import, the full name and sortable name will change, but the display name is not changed. The email address is added but still not marked default.
Select UI Option
Overriding UI changes also allows one of two additional options: process as UI changes or clear UI-changed state. You can only select one option. 
If you want to select an options, select the checkbox next to your preference:
Process as UI changes: overrides changes that have taken place in the UI as "sticky" data; all data acts as if the changes were actually manually updated in the UI
Clear UI-changed state: removes the "stickiness" of all data that exists in this import; future imports with this data will not indicate any data in the UI as "sticky"
Process Data
Click the Process Data button.
View Import Data
When the import has processed, Canvas displays the results of the imported file, along with up to 50 errors and warnings. If you imported a full batch update, the results also show the number of deleted items removed from the account. Deleted items include enrollments, courses, and sections.
After you refresh the page, this information will stay in the SIS Import page under the Last Batch heading until another import is made.
Download Errors
If you want to download all warnings and errors from your last import file, return to the SIS Import page. Under the Last Batch heading, click the Last Batch download icon. The icon will download a CSV file with all errors and warnings from your last import.
You can also use the SIS Import Errors API for additional troubleshooting details, which will return the CSV line number where the error occurred.

Regrade Question Types
Currently, quiz regrade is available Multiple Choice, True/False, and Multiple Answers question types. 
Learn how to regrade Multiple Choice questions
Learn how to regrade True/False questions
Learn how to regrade Multiple Answers questions
Regrade Restrictions
Quiz regrade does not apply to questions linked to a question bank since questions may be used in more than one quiz. 
Additionally, adding or deleting answers from a question with submissions disables the option to regrade that question.
Regrade Options
When you change the correct answer in a quiz question, Canvas presents up to four quiz regrade options, depending on the question type.
Award Points for Both Answers
Using quiz analytics or student feedback, you may find that students found a question too confusing, or you realized that the question could have been listed with multiple answers when only one was selected. In cases like these, you can select the Award points for both corrected and previously correct answers option to avoid penalizing your students.
Notes: 
If a question has been regraded multiple times, the Award points for both corrected and previously correct answers option only awards points for the corrected answer and the latest answer marked as correct.
This option is not available for Multiple Answer questions.
Award Points for Correct Answer
Occasionally an incorrect answer may get marked as the correct answer for a quiz. The Only award points for the corrected answer option allows you to correct the answer and give credit to those who selected the answer that should have been correct. 
Give Everyone Full Credit 
In some cases it might be appropriate to simply give everyone full credit for a question. Select the Give everyone full credit for this question option.
Update without Regrading
If you need to improve your question or answers for a future quiz, you can select the Update question without regrading option to update a question without regrading the students who have already taken the quiz.What are Modules

Auto Show Closed Captions
By default, this feature is set to Off. 
The Auto Show Closed Captions feature setting allows you to enable captions added to videos by default for your Canvas account. 
Note: Videos embedded from third-party tools, such as Youtube, are not supported. Additionally, embedded Canvas Studio videos are not yet supported. 
Course Set-Up Tutorial
This feature only displays if your institution has enabled the Canvas course setup tutorial. By default, this feature only displays for new users enrolled as instructors and is set to Off.
The Course Set-up Tutorial feature setting allows you to view the course set-up tutorial. When enabled, this feature displays a tutorial in each Course Navigation index page that shows you the purpose of the page and what to do next. The tutorial applies to all of your courses in Canvas where you are enrolled as an instructor. 
Disable Alert Notification Timeouts
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Disable Alert Notification Timeouts feature setting prevents alert notification pop-ups from timing out. When this feature is enabled, alert notifications in Canvas will display until you manually dismiss the alert.
Disable Celebration Animations
This feature only displays if your institution has enabled confetti for valid links. By default this feature is set to Off.
The Disable Celebration Animations feature setting allows you to disable celebration animations that display when you run the link validator in your course. When enabled, celebration animations will no longer display in Canvas.
Disable Keyboard Shortcuts
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Disable Keyboard Shortcuts feature setting allows you to disable keyboard shortcuts in Modules, Discussions, the Gradebook, and SpeedGrader. Other areas of Canvas will be updated at a future date.
This feature allows users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation to control their experience in Canvas with keyboard shortcuts.
High Contrast UI
By default this feature is set to Off.
The High Contrast UI feature setting allows you to view Canvas using high contrast styles. This feature enhances the color contrast of the user interface (text, buttons, etc.) so they are more distinct and easier to identify in Canvas. However, institutional branding is not supported when this feature is enabled, so you will not be able to view the institution's logo or other elements.
You can also enable High Contrast UI from your User Navigation Menu.
Microsoft Immersive Reader
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Microsoft Immersive Reader enhances accessibility and comprehension for any reader. When enabled, the course home page, assignments, pages, and syllabus display an Immersive Reader button.
Microsoft Immersive Reader is available for you to enable individually, regardless of the preference set at the account level. However, if the feature is on for the entire account, the account preference overrides your user preference, and your user setting has no effect.
To learn more about this feature, see the Microsoft Immersive Reader website.
Open To-Do Items in a New Tab
By default this feature is set to On. 
The Open to-do items in a new tab feature setting allows you to open Grade Assignment links from your Dashboard To Do list in a new browser tab. Disabling this feature allows you to open Grade Assignment links from your Dashboard To Do list in the existing browser tab.
Underline Links
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Underline Links feature setting allows you to view Canvas interface links as underlined text. When enabled, this feature underlines hyperlinks in navigation menus, the Dashboard, and page sidebars. This feature setting does not apply to user-generated content links in the Rich Content Editor, which always underlines links for all users.
CSV Separator Preferences
You can set how you want to view separators in CSV export files, depending on your locale or preference.
Separator settings are managed through one of three feature settings in User Settings. These settings only apply to compatible spreadsheet exports.
Autodetect Field Separators in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports
The Autodetect field separators feature setting attempts to determine the appropriate field separator as indicated by the language set in the user’s account. For languages where the decimal separator is a dot, (e.g. 1,234.56), autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator. For languages where the decimal separator is a comma, (e.g. 1.234,56), autodetection will choose a semicolon as the field separator. For all other cases, autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator as a default.
Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Use semicolons to separate fields setting is enabled.
Include Byte-Order Mark in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports
The Include Byte-Order Mark feature setting generates a specific set of three characters at the beginning of the CSV file. These characters, known as a byte-order mark, help some versions of Microsoft Excel understand that the CSV file is a UTF-8 encoded file. It also tells some localized versions of Excel that they should treat the incoming CSV file as if it were semicolon-separated by default. Because some versions of Excel do not understand or honor the byte-order mark, this feature allows all users to disable generation of this byte-order mark.
Use Semicolons to Separate Fields in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports
The Use semicolons to separate fields feature setting generates CSV files with semicolons as the field separators instead of the default comma. When disabled, this feature falls back to behavior determined by the state of the Autodetect field separators setting.
Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Autodetect Field Separators setting is enabled.How do I create an SIS support case in the Field Admin Console as an admin

Mobile Browsers
You can access Canvas from any browser on your Android/iOS device. However, mobile browsers are not supported, and features may not function as expected compared to viewing Canvas in a fully supported desktop browser. 
On mobile devices, Canvas is designed to be used within Canvas mobile applications. Canvas pages within a mobile browser are only supported when an action in the app links directly to the browser, such as when a student takes certain types of quizzes. Support is not extended to pages that cannot currently be used in the app, such as Conferences or Collaborations.
Additionally, Canvas offers limited support for native mobile browsers on tablet devices. For details, please reference the limited-support mobile browser guidelines.
Mobile Applications
We are actively improving our native mobile applications to support as many Canvas features as possible. Instructure has four native mobile applications for instructors free for download on both phones and tablets.
Canvas Teacher App (iOS 10.0+, Android 5.0+). This app allows you to manage course content and grade student submissions on the go. Syncs with SpeedGrader and the Gradebook. View Canvas Teacher mobile features by version and device.

Script Programming Languages
The import script can be as simple or complex as your institution requires. Additionally, a variety of programming languages can be used to write your import script/program. As long as the programming language can make HTTPS calls and upload files via HTTPS the language can be used to create an import script. 
Due to a tremendous amount of variables that exist among each institution, Canvas does not officially support or promote the use of any specific scripting language or script that users can import data to Canvas, such as:
Bash Shell (cURL)
C#
Java
PowerShell
Python
Server File Folders
On the server or computer that will run the import process (Windows/Linux/Mac), you'll need to create a folder structure to store your import applications (script, logs, active files, etc).
Script Considerations
A simple example of an SIS script is to create a script that runs at specific times and checks a directory in your folder scructure to see if there are files that need to be sent to Canvas. If there are files, the script could compress them into a .zip file and send them to Canvas. View the SIS script flowchart. 
When creating a script, you should consider potential problems such as: 
Whether the script checks for errors to see if the upload succeeded.
Whether the script looks to see if the last import is finished. If you set your run frequency shorter than the import processing time for a run, the frequency could result in new batches queuing before an import is finished.
Whether the script looks to see if there is a previous import—and whether or not the previous import succeeded. This verification is important regardless of whether full batch or standard imports are used as you do not want updates to run out of order.
Sample Scripts
The Canvas Community has provided a GitHub repository of sample scripts that address many script considerations. Even with very simple tools, these examples show how to implement a basic automated import script.
Note: Each sample GitHub script will have its own requirements and additional components that may need to be installed for proper functionality.
By using the tools that are presented in these tutorials, you should now be better prepared to create your own automated import tool. If you run into challenges, please visit our migration and integration community forum. You may find other people there who can help with comments and suggestions on your script.How do I import outcomes into a course in Improved Outcomes Management as an instructor

Import file contains no data
Invalid headers are present
Invalid UTF-8 string
Required fields are missing
Required headings are missing
Other headings are placed after the ratings header

View Grading Overview
The grading section gives an overview of the student's course grade. The student's current grade displays as shown in the Gradebook according to grading scheme. 
For courses using Multiple Grading Periods, the context card only displaysthe grade for the current grading period. Note that the grading period view in the Gradebook does not influence the grade display; the student context card always displays the current grading period, regardless of whether you view a prior or future grading period.
The card also shows the number of missing assignments and late assignments. Missing assignments are based on course analytics data, which generates data for online submission assignments in Canvas. For submissions not submitted online, assignment calculations may not be entirely accurate as they are attempted based on the assignment’s grade and when the assignment was graded.  Late assignments are based on assignment due date . 
In the Last Graded Items section, you can view a maximum of the student's last 10 recently graded assignments along with the assignment’s grade, shown according to grading scheme. If the grading scheme does not fit in the window, the grades default to points. To view the name of an assignment, hover over a graded item. To view submission details for the assignment, click the graded item.
View Activity Overview
The activity section provides an overview of the student's participation compared to other students in the course. It is not meant to be an exact comparison and is based on the standard deviation of the student's participation and page views in the course. 
The activity level is indicated by stars that represent no participation, low participation, moderate participation, and high participation.  Students with no page views receive zero stars. Students whose participation falls in the lowest quartile of course activity receive one star. Students whose participation falls in the middle two quartiles receive two stars. Students whose participation falls in the top quartile receive three stars. 
Participation information may help you quickly identify at-risk students in your course. For instance, a student with both high participation and high page views is probably a high-performance student who submits coursework and participates in course discussions, assignments, and other activities. A student with no participation or page views is most likely not engaged in the course and may need some assistance or participation encouragement.
Note: More accurate details about course activity can be viewed by accessing the student's analytics page or user details page, both of which may be available to you to access from the Student overview section of the context card.

Create New Assignment with Zero Point Value
Create a new assignment with zero points possible and select any submission type. Assignments set to the No Submission type work well for classroom activities, such as in-class discussions or presentations.
After students complete an online submission or complete and submit work offline, you can add and adjust points in the Gradebook.
Note: For a zero-point assignment to factor into a student's grade, you must add a positive point value to at least one additional assignment in any assignment group.
Add Extra Points to an Existing Assignment
Add extra points to an Assignment you've already created. Manually enter the extra points in the Gradebook.
For example, this assignment is worth 40 points. Adding 5 extra points will bring the assignment total for this student to 45 points. The added points will increase total points calculated in the Gradebook's final grade. 
Add Fudge Points to a Quiz
You can use Fudge points within SpeedGrader to add points to a quiz. Fudge points allow you to manually adjust an overall quiz score.
Create Extra Credit within a Rubric
Add an additional Criterion to a Rubric for extra credit. Make sure you make the rubric worth more than the assignment and you can give students extra points or not without affecting the actual assignment points. 
Add Extra Points using a Rubric in SpeedGrader
You can add extra credit using a rubric in SpeedGrader. Enter a point value that is greater than the points possible for a criterion. The Total Points calculation will reflect any extra points awarded for each Criterion.
Note: For SpeedGrader to automatically update the rubric point value for grading, select the Use this rubric for assignment grading checkbox when adding the Rubric to an assignment. Otherwise, you can update the grade field manually.
Add Extra Points using SpeedGrader
You can manually add extra points by editing the grade shown in the Grade field in SpeedGrader.
Create Extra Credit with Assignment Groups
Assignments must be housed within an assignment group. Assignment groups can be unweighted or weighted, depending on how you wish to grade students within your course.
Learn more about giving extra credit using assignment groups.
Notes: 
Assignments in the extra credit assignment group should be graded at the end of the course, after all other course assignments are graded. 
All other assignment groups in the course should have at least one graded assignment in order for the extra credit assignment group calculation to correctly affect student grades. 
Create Extra Credit using Unweighted Assignment Groups
When assignment groups are not weighted, you can create extra credit assignments in their own assignment group if you wish. You may want to create a separate group to help distinguish between the different types of assignments. In this example, this entire assignment group has no points possible. 
When the student completes the work required for the extra credit assignments, you can manually add points to the Gradebook.
Create Extra Credit using Weighted Assignment Groups
When assignment groups are weighted, Canvas will not calculate grades for an entire group that has no points possible. Therefore, for extra credit assignments to calculate correctly in weighted groups, they must be housed within an existing assignment group that has at least one assignment worth more than zero points. 
In this example, the extra credit assignment is housed within the Extra Credit assignment group with multiple assignments worth more than zero points. Notice that the assignment groups weights total 110%. Any assignment placed within the Extra Credit assignment group will have either a positive or neutral effect on your students' overall grade. Additionally, if a student does not submit the extra credit assignment, their grade will not be negatively impacted. 
When the student completes the work required for the extra credit assignments, you can manually add points to the Gradebook.
Errors with Weighted Assignment Group
If you create your extra credit assignments with zero points within their own assignment group, but you decide to weigh your assignment groups, your extra credit assignments will not calculate correctly within Canvas. Canvas cannot calculate assignment groups where there are no points possible. For example, if the student has 12 points of 0 points possible, Canvas can't determine the impact to the overall grade because 12 cannot be divided by 0.
An error will appear in the total grade column. In this example, the two extra credit assignments (both with zero possible points) have been placed in an assignment group called Extra Credit. However, the assignment group has been weighted. The warning notification indicates that the score does not include Extra Credit (as an assignment group) because the entire group has no points possible. In this situation, the assignments will have to be moved to another assignment group, or you will need to include an assignment within the Extra Credit assignment group that has at least one point possible.How do I view my institution's Public Course Index as an admin

Instructor View
The Calendar is used for reminding students of graded Assignments with specific due dates. To provide students with detailed descriptions of how synchronous class time will be used, consider using Pages or customizing the Course Home Page.
The Calendar automatically syncs with other features in Canvas, such as Assignments, Syllabus, and Grades, so if you create, change, or delete the due date of an Assignment on the Calendar, it will show up in all the others and vice versa. You can change dates easily by dragging and dropping assignments from one date to another. 
When would I use the Calendar as an instructor?
As an instructor, use the Calendar to:
View and create activities in your course as well as events and personal reminders; you can also filter the calendar view to only see specific calendars.
Quickly add Assignments to a blank course. Fill in the details of those Assignments later.
Adjust the dates of Assignments that have been imported from previous terms. Canvas makes it easy to drag and drop events across multiple months.
Copy the iCal feed for all of your courses and import it to your preferred personal Calendar, such as Google or Outlook.
Set recurring calendar events.
Schedule appointments with students using the Scheduler (optional feature).
Subscribe to Account Calendars made by admins (optional feature).
Student View
Students can use the calendar to view their upcoming course events and assignments. They can also create personal events such as study groups.
When would I use the Calendar as a student?
When would I use the Calendar as a student?
View course calendars and group calendars.
Create personal calendar reminders.
Filter the calendar view to only see specific calendars.
Copy the iCal feed for all of your courses and import it to your preferred personal Calendar, such as Google or Outlook. 
Set recurring calendar events.
Subscribe to Account Calendars made by admins (optional feature).Importing SIS CSV files
Review Error Messages
If you find a file has failed, review any error messages that are available to you on the SIS Imports page. You may find that the file itself had an error message, or that particular lines in the file failed, under the Last Batch section.
Note: Certain error messages require you to contact support to review.
Review CSV Header Formatting
The CSV requires specific formatting to upload properly. In particular, you will want to review the CSV headers.
For more information about formatting CSV files, visit the Canvas Guides.
Confirm CSV is UTF-8 Encoded
SIS Imports CSVs are required to be encoded in UTF-8 without byte order mark. Most applications will automatically encode for UTF-8, though some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, will change to an alternate encoding.
If your software is capable of encoding files out of UTF-8, you should be able to specifically select UTF-8 as an option when saving. The exact steps of this process will depend on the application.

Note: The Quiz icon represents both classic quizzes and New Quizzes question types.
To filter by assignment type, remove the checkbox next to the assignment type. The chart dynamically updates the results based on the assignment type selected or removed in the filter.

To export analytics data as a CSV file, click the Download CSV button.
CSV data is exported according to the filtered data.
CSV files display a student's full name, sortable name, Canvas user ID, SIS user ID or email (if applicable), overall course grade, the percent that assignments have been on time, the last page view time, the last participation time, and the last time the student logged out.How do I view the status of current and prior course imports as an instructor
Open Settings
In Course Navigation, click the Settings link.
Import Content into Course
Click the Import Course Content link.
View Current Jobs
The Current Jobs menu displays the status of your import. Canvas can display several import statuses.
View Queued
When an import is first uploaded, the status displays as queued. Canvas copies may also display as pre-processing. These statuses both mean that Canvas is preparing the file for import. 
View Running
When a report is uploading, the status displays as Running. Running reports display a progress bar indicating the time remaining to complete the import.
View Waiting for Select
If you chose to select specific content as part of the import process, the current job shows as Waiting for Select, which means you must select the content you want to import before it can be completed. You cannot cancel this action. Click the Select Content button.
Once you select content, the statuses will return to Queued and Running until Canvas imports the selected content.
Note: If you no longer want to select specific content and want to import all content instead, click the Select Content button and simply select all content and groups available for importing.
View Completed
When your import is complete, the status displays as Completed. View imported content by accessing any link in Course Navigation.
A Completed status shown in orange indicate the import contains errors. To view the specific error(s), click the issues link. Examples of error issues include an external tool that needs to be reconfigured or content that includes a broken link. 
View Failed
If an import is unsupported or otherwise cannot be imported, the status displays as Failed. To view the specific error(s), click the issues link.
View Previous Import
You can view previously imported content using the link next to the import type.
For imported files, click the content name. The file will download to your computer. File imports cannot be downloaded for re-import after 500 days.
For course copies, clicking the link will take you back to the course that was copied. What feature options can I enable in my user account as a student
Auto Show Closed Captions
By default, this feature is set to Off. 
The Auto Show Closed Captions feature setting allows you to enable captions added to videos by default for your Canvas account. 
Note: Videos embedded from third-party tools, such as Youtube, are not supported. Additionally, embedded Canvas Studio videos are not yet supported. 
Disable Alert Notification Timeouts
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Disable Alert Notification Timeouts feature setting prevents alert notification pop-ups from timing out. When this feature setting is enabled, alert notifications in Canvas display until you manually dismiss the alert.
Disable Celebration Animations
By default this feature is set to Off. 
The Disable Celebration Animations setting allows you to turn off all celebration animations. The Celebration feature must be enabled by a Canvas admin at your institution. If this feature is not enabled, the Disable Celebration Animations setting will not display in your user Feature Settings. Learn how to manage confetti animations. 
Disable Keyboard Shortcuts
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Disable Keyboard Shortcuts feature setting allows you to disable keyboard shortcuts in Modules, Discussions, the Gradebook, and SpeedGrader. Other areas of Canvas will be updated at a future date.
This setting allows users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation to control their experience in Canvas with keyboard shortcuts.
High Contrast UI
By default this feature is set to Off.
The High Contrast UI feature setting allows you to view Canvas using high contrast styles. This feature enhances the color contrast of the user interface (text, buttons, etc.) so they are more distinct and easier to identify in Canvas. However, institutional branding is not supported when this feature is enabled, so you will not be able to view the institution's logo or other elements.
You can also enable High Contrast UI from your User Navigation Menu.
Microsoft Immersive Reader
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Microsoft Immersive Reader enhances accessibility and comprehension for any reader. When enabled, the course home page, assignments, pages, and syllabus display an Immersive Reader button.
Microsoft Immersive Reader is available for you to enable individually, regardless of the preference set at the account level. However, if the feature is on for the entire account, the account preference overrides your user preference, and your user setting has no effect.
To learn more about this feature, see the Microsoft Immersive Reader website.
Underline Links
By default this feature is set to Off.
The Underline Links feature setting allows you to view Canvas interface links as underlined text. When enabled, this feature underlines hyperlinks in navigation menus, the Dashboard, and page sidebars. This feature setting does not apply to user-generated content links in the Rich Content Editor, which always underlines links for all users.
CSV Separator Preferences
You can set how you want to view separators in CSV export files, depending on your locale or preference.
Separator settings are managed through one of three feature settings in User Settings. These settings only apply to compatible spreadsheet exports. 
Autodetect Field Separators in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports
The Autodetect field separators feature settings attempts to determine the appropriate field separator as indicated by the language set in the user’s account. For languages where the decimal separator is a dot, (e.g. 1,234.56), autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator. For languages where the decimal separator is a comma, (e.g. 1.234,56), autodetection will choose a semicolon as the field separator. For all other cases, autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator as a default.
Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Use semicolons to separate fields setting is enabled.
Include Byte-Order Mark in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports
The Include Byte-Order Mark feature setting generates a specific set of three characters at the beginning of the CSV file. These characters, known as a byte-order mark, help some versions of Microsoft Excel understand that the CSV file is a UTF-8 encoded file. It also tells some localized versions of Excel that they should treat the incoming CSV file as if it were semicolon-separated by default. Because some versions of Excel do not understand or honor the byte-order mark, this feature allows all users to disable generation of this byte-order mark.
Use Semicolons to Separate Fields in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports
The Use semicolons to separate fields feature setting generates CSV files with semicolons as the field separators instead of the default comma. When disabled, this feature falls back to behavior determined by the state of the Autodetect field separators setting.
Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Autodetect Field Separators setting is enabled.How do I create an assignment using the Google Assignments LTI 1
